            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:34971:3"/>
for prayer, the great content which you tooke in ſpeaking, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing of ſpirituall matters; and aboue all, the ſeruent deſyre you had, to aduance your ſoul, in the way of perfection, and the loue of God; for vvhich end (if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) you told me, that ſomtymes, your ſiſters, and your ſelfe, of purpoſe, did viſit the moſt honourable, and truly vertuous Lady of Thurles, your Mother in law, though liuing a farre of; and parting thence, as from the ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and Miſtriſſe of vertue, all of you were wholy renewed in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with great feruour, and deſire of more ſeriouſly louing, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, the only goodneſſe, and faithfull ſpouſe of all deuout and louing ſoules.</p>

2. Reflecting (I ſay) on theſe, (with which certainly I was not a litle edified) I did reſolue for your ſpirituall comfort, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their's, to dedicate this Soul's delight, to your Ladiship, with whom, I knowe, it will receiue a better welcome, then thoſe boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which treate of the vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and pleaſures, of this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory world. And though the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and ſubſtance be but ſmall, yet your humility, and piety, is ſuch, that I feare you will priſe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its worth, through that high eſteeme you haue, of the ſmalleſt treatiſe (though neuer ſo ſimple) which ſpeaketh of God; this being a true token of the loue you beare to his diuine Maieſty.</p>
                  <p>3. Madame, I haue conſidered
<pb facs="tcp:34971:4"/>
it; and well may all that knowes your Ladiship, admire, to ſee ſo many vertues (but chiefely ſo great humility) in a ſoul of ſo worldly an outward show. Yet truly, I cannot but confeſſe, that it is the prerogatiue of a vertuous ſoul, and not the leaſt of vertues, to know, how to cloake and hyde without note, the inward graces and gifts of God. But as the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perfumes which are cloſely shutvp, being openned, with greater vigour and fragrancy of their odours, doe recreat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſuch as are preſent, euen ſo thoſe ſweet hidden vertues, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shutvp in the ſecret cabinet of your deuout ſoul, venting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by that ſpirituall language of yours, cannot but very much

comfort, and delight the hearers; which, and your actions, doe tell vs, what fire that ſmoake com's from; and more then ſo, it leaueth in the hearts, of ſuch as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with, no ſmall deſire to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with the ſame fire; experience teacheth what I ſpeake, I ſay no more; but doe acknowledg that it hath beene a motiue to me, not only dayly to commend your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship to God, in my poore pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, but alſo to addreſſe this litle worke, vnto you, which treateth of prayer being an excellent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to forvvard a ſoul ſo pious, and amynd ſo vertuous, in true perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the loue of God.</p>
                  <p>4. Accept therefore of it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, not ſo much for its vvorth, as for the affection vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revvith

But much more we doe dayly heare, of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, who is more then Salomon, being the eternall wiſdome of God the Father; how happy then muſt they be, who are, and canne be, when they pleaſe in his Holy preſence, in prayer, there conſidering, his greatneſſe, Maieſty, and glory; and in the ſecret of their heart, hearing thoſe mellifluous ſpeeches, and delightfull words of life, falling from his bleſſed mouth, to their great ioy and comfort; for often heere, their ſpirits fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le them and they are eleuated farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond themſelues. he admitteth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to his preſence, conuerſation, and familiarity, without exception; he is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to giue audience, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenner they come to him; the better is their wellcome, yea the more he doth fauour them, and beſtow his gifts and graces vppon them; and his goodneſſe is ſuch, that he is not diſpleaſed with their preſence, nor troubled at their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as worldly princes are, but ioyfull to ſee them, delighted to heare them, much pleaſed to haue the occaſion to shew his willingnes to graunt what they demand, and he often giues more, then they know, to aske.</p>

2. Prayer maketh one ſo inward with God, ſo great, and Gracious in his ſight, and ſo confident of his fauour, that his diuine Maieſty canne hardly deny him any requeſt what ſoeuer. Examples of this truth, you may read dayly in Holy Scripture, and the liues of Saints; as when God in his wrath and anger, ſaid, that he would vtterly deſtroy the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael for their wickednes and grieuous ſinns; Moyſes familiarly, and <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:34971:7"/>
the dead to life againe. Alſo our Holy Mother S. Tereſa writes in her life, that <note place="margin">

                  <p>3. And you muſt obſerue, that in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, there is no exception of perſons with God; for he giues his graces, as well to the poore, as to the rich and to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant's women, as to the learnedſt men. neither muſt I heere let paſſe, what ſome with little reaſon ſay; to wit; that bookes treating of prayer, high and miſticall things, are not fit for, nor to be dedicated to women. But with their fauour, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are as capable and apt according to their naturall diſpoſition for this exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of prayer, and receiuing diuine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and illuminations of eternall verities, from the Father of light, as men. for they haue a reaſonable ſoul, as well
<pb facs="tcp:34971:8"/>
as men, which, God when he pleaſe may eleuat to ſupernaturall things; for he is not tyed to any, nor his power limited, but well knowes, how, when, and to whom, to giue his gracious fauours, this depending only of his owne will; and his holy Spirit, where, and when he pleaſe, inſpireth, lightneth, inflameth with diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne loue, and inſtructeth the ſoul of men and women, in the knowledg of moſt high and hidde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>4. For the whole frame of prayer is grounded vppon two points, which are humility, and loue; in theſe, it is well knowen, that women are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Tereſa, as she relates in her life; and experience hath taught from age to age, that they were eminent in the loue of God, and that their liues, and bookes written of diuine Matters,
<pb facs="tcp:34971:8"/>
euen at this day, giues admiration to the world. The declaration of ſupernaturall things in viſions and reuelations written by S. Heldegardis, S. Mathild, S. Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitta, S. Iſabell, S. Catherin of Siena, and diuers of that ſexe, are teſtimonyes of this truth, and for a more ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof, what shall we ſay of the rare workes, bookes, and doctrine of our holy Mother S. Tereſa which, as the ſunne at midday, doth illuminate the whole Church, in the knowledg of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and the wayes, by which God doth communicat himſelfe in it, to ſuch as doe truly ſerue and loue him.

                  <p>5. But to conclude (after my long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion) I could heartely wish, that all men and women, would vſe this mentall prayer; for it is the ofſpring, or fountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of true knowledg, the ornament of <note place="margin">Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer.</note> the memory, the ioy of the will, the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the mynd, the treaſure and glory of the ſoul; for by it, we come to the true, and feeling knowledg of our ſelues, and God; there, in our neceſſityes, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we haue recourſe to him, who is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull, canne, and will help vs: for as long as we liue in this bannishment, we are like to a citty ſtrongly beſeiged by

Paul, to pray without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, and our Sauiour did admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Apoſtles to watch and pray, leaſt they should fall into temptation.</p>
                  <p>6. Prayer, S. Iſidor ſayes, is a ſcourge to our enemyes, the reliefe and refuge of a ſinner, a comfort to our neighbours, and a ſacrifice to God moſt acceptable; our holy Mother S. Tereſa had therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re good reaſon to extoll it with high praiſes, as being worthy, to be eſteemed, vſed, and dayly practiſed by all ſort of people, and as that wherein their greateſt ſafety doth conſiſt; and whence all good, and ſpirituall happineſſe in this life, doth proceede; and without which, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſcape the dangers, and hurts of our enemyes, whiles we are in this mortality. So that prayer, as is ſayd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leading way, to the kingdome of heauen; and that in the houſe of God, there are many manſions, and not one, and the ſame way, leading to all; nor
<pb facs="tcp:34971:10"/>
each one, apt, or fit, to walke, or goe on in euery way; I thought good to deuide this treatiſe, into three partes, out of which each one according to his ſtate of life, and occaſions, may chooſe what way to take, and what exerciſe, to vſe.</p>
                  <p>7. In the firſt, I doe declare what pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is, in a generall manner, the abuſe thereof, and how to pray with profit: and then a dayly exerciſe to that end. alſo I doe ſet downe ſome pious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man's creation, mouing vs to the knowledg of our ſelues, and our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and duty to God: then the great hurt of ſinne, and man's condemnation, Chriſt's loue, in redeeming vs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, how to goe well prepared to confeſſion, and communion, and to be diſpoſed, to dye well, with ſome deuout prayers, and short meditations.</p>
                  <p>8, In the ſecond, the benefit and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of mentall prayer, are expreſſed, and explicated, with aduiſes for the better vſe, and practiſe thereof, after this, the declaration of the purgatiue, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and vnitiue life, and what to them are proper.</p>
                  <p>9. In the third part, there is a briefe relation of ſupernaturall prayer much according to the mynd of our Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:34971:10"/>
S. Tereſa, not that I intend to teach what it is, but that pious ſoules (reading the great effects of it, and the many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fauours which God is wont to beſtow on thoſe that giue themſelues ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to his ſeruice) may be animated, and encourraged to goe forward with great alacrity of ſpirit in this Holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of prayer, which is not the leaſt of his great benefits, and bleſſings; and which I humbly beſeech his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, to graunt vnto many, by the vſe of this booke, for his honour and glory, and the good of his Holy Church, which is the ſcope I ayme at, and the end, of all my deſires, and labour. Amen.</p>

                        <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any that are giuen to prayer, doe gaine litle profit thereby, becauſe they doe not well know, nor conſider what pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is; for if they had knowen it, tis like they would be more attentiue in it, and vſe it as they ought; and ſo we should haue more ſaints then there are, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more ſoules.</p>
                        <p>2. You muſt therefore vnderſtand, that prayer generally taken, is an eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or application of the mynd to God; ſo, that notwithſtanding a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth many Good words with his mouth, and ſeemeth to pray; not hauing this eleuation; it is no prayer, by reaſon the mynd is not eleuated, or applyed to God. As for example, a chyld required by his Father, or Maſter, to read very Godly prayers in ſome deuout, booke, either to paſſe the tyme, or know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34971:14"/>
he canne read, or no; is not ſaid to pray, though he read's the moſt deuout prayer that canne be. Why ſo? becauſe he intended not to pray, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing (which is the application of the mynd to God) is wanting, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore Chriſt our Sauiour ſpeaking to the Phariſes, ſaid, yee hipocrits, did not Eſaias Prophecy well of you ſaying, this people doth praiſe me with their lips or <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note> mouth, but their heart is farre from me. this he ſaid in the behalfe of God, by which you may obſerue, that our ſauiour doth tearme him an hypocrit, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, who maketh shew of that which is not, mouing his lips, as in prayer, but not applying his heart or mynd to God.</p>
                        <p>3. But alas, how many Phariſes and Hypocrits, may be found this day, euen among the very Catholikes, that make shew of praying, and ſeruing God, their hearts and mynds being farre from him? VVe haue the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or Lords Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, appointed by our Sauiour, to be ſaid, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note> as the moſt excellent of all praiers, and many Godly bookes with deuout pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers, and hymnes approued by the church, for the vſe, and benefit of all Chriſtians; and though vocally ſaid, yet they are of great merit in the ſight of God, being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34971:14"/>
well and attentiuely vſed, according to the former application. Yet I am ſory, that there be many, ſo worldly and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that they pray no way, though in Chriſtian duty obliged to pray; nay, they ſcarſe call to mynd, whether there be a God, or no. which the Turkes doe not forger; ſo that going to bed, or getting vpp, before meat, or after, they giue no thankes, but couch, and feede, as the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te beaſt's doe; or, as if they were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, (being reaſonable creatures) to praiſe, and giue God thankes, for their being, life, health, foode, conſeruation night and day, from ſudden death, and other dangers; which (as others) they are ſubiect to. And if by chance they go to church on holy dayes to heare maſſe, or diuine ſeruice, being therunto bound, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of mortall ſinne, they mynd more to gaſe heere and there, on this or that body, attyre, or new fashion, or giue their mynd to wander on idle things, then what they ought to doe in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; and if they ſay ſome prayer, as their beads, (for bookes they doe not vſe) they know not what, or how they ſay it, they are ſo much diſtracted, and their mynd perhaps in the marker, tauerne, or ſome worſſe place; and to thoſe, the maſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34971:15"/>
(though short, as not a full halfe hour) ſeemes ſo long, that they are there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and thinke it will neuer end; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they doe not expect till then, but are away before tyme, that their body may be preſent, where their heart, and mynd were all the tyme of maſſe.</p>
                        <p>4. Truly the light of faith is very much obſcured, and darkned in theſe repid, and luke warme Catholikes; are not they in a poore caſe? what canne they expect, or hope for, at the hour of death, from God; whom in their life they did ſo litle reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and regard? for though his diuine maieſty be mercifull, he is alſo iuſt; and when his mercy is not accepted, but abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his iuſtice will in due tyme inflict a condigne punnishment; God's mercy was great (note this well) who endured with patience ſo many yeares ſuch wrongs, and abuſes (as their grieuous ſinns, and did not caſt them ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire, as he did the Angells of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for one only ſinne,) graciouſly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their conuerſion and repentance, which they thinke not of, putting all off, either till they grow old, or fall ſick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending then to repent; as if the tyme, and certainty of repentance were in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and at their diſpoſall. but what if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34971:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they be short taken, and the thread of their life cutt off by a ſudden death? (which doth dayly happen to many) what will become of them? which they ought rather to conſider; o then for a moment, wherein they might haue made vſe of gods mercy, when they liued, (an did not) and gained the ioyes of heauen by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which they neglected, they muſt endure without remiſſion the rigour of Gods iuſtice, and ſuffer the torments of hell fire, for all eternity. woe be vnto them; O deere Chriſtian beware of this, and repent whiles thou haſt tyme, not knowing but that very hour, is the laſt of thy life;</p>
                        <p>5. There be others whoſe deuotion is but ſmall, and ſome tymes they haue a confuſed memory of their obligation, to ſerue God; and thence they feare his pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: which make them ſome tyme goe to prayer, maſſe, and thoſe things, to which they are bound; as to confeſſe and receaue, at leaſt once a yeare; which they doe very coldly, and god grant they doe it, to their profit: which I feare they doe not, for want of due preparation, though the ſaluation or damnation of their ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, depend vppon it. their prayers are not many, and in haſte, thinking that to ſay
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34971:16"/>
them, is enough, and that they haue don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne well, and a great matter too: but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are miſtaken, (though they doe better then the former)<hi>:</hi> for what honour haue they donne to God therein, or what great profit, to them ſelues? that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not for what, or to whom they praid; whereas they minded him not, all the tyme of prayer; but rather when they should end, to be gone away; which is a great abuſe of prayer, and diſreſpect to God. there are many of this ſort, whoſe caſe is dangerous enough, and they are to be pittied, inſtructed, and admonished by their Paſtors.</p>
                        <p>6. An other ſort of people I find, that haue a good cuſtome to goe euery day to prayer, and to heare maſſe, which is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but if they should truly examen themſelues, when all is donne, perhaps they would find, that they were thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their worldly affaires moſt of the tyme, and did ſcarſe reflect vppon what prayers they ſaid, being ſmoothly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with ſome thoughts, which the deuil doth ſuggeſt according to their inclination, or naturall diſpoſition; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, they take ſuch content, that they, eaſily forget what in prayer they are ſaying; for he doth know how to ſit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34971:16"/>
euery mans humour; yet by reaſon their firſt intention was good, it maketh the reſt ſomewhat meritorious, when their diſtraction was not wholy woluntary; but they cannot be excuſed for their negligence, and diſreſpect to God, who is preſent, and to whom they ought in prayer, to addreſſe their ſpeech with great humility and reuerence.</p>
                        <p>7. Others there are, that haue that good cuſtome, and they taske them ſelues with a certaine number of prayers, which when they haue performed, they thinke, that they haue donne much; but whiles they pray, their mynd runns more on when they shall end their taske; then how to pleaſe or praiſe God, and therefore, they often lift their beades, or turne the leafe of the booke, to ſee where abouts they are; and in the meane tyme; their mynd is a wandering, and their tongue runns in all poſte, not knowing why, or whither; but makes haſt to come to his iorney's end, that is. till all is ſaid: and ſo very ſpeedily they part. yet though this be an abuſe, it is of more importance then the others; for they haue not only an intention going to prayer, to ſerue God, but alſo to ſpend tyme to performe that taske which they haue obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34971:17"/>
to; though afterwards they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, or carried away, with vaine thoughts; an other good, it hath, that they are neuer quiet, nor ſatisfied, till they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue performed the ſaid number of prayers both morning and euening, which makes them myndfull of God, when they are about buſineſſe, and haue not ended all.</p>
                        <p>8. But what shall we ſay of men that ſeeme to be of vnderſtanding and know much? and canne diſcourſe of our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to God, when they are among thoſe that ſpeake of that matter, yet are as careleſſe of their duty to god, as others, and perhaps more; they ſeldome pray at home, and when they frequent the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they ſtand and gaſe; they come to ſee, and be ſeene; and often, for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's ſake, rather then to pray; as to attend this nobleman, or that lady whom they leade by the hand, more then for the loue of god; and many tymes, to meete this or that frend, or party, with whom they haue ſome buſineſſe; on which their mynd is more buſied, then on their prayers; but thoſe young gallants and damicell's are worſt of all, that prate, and laugh euen at maſſe and euen ſonge; they lightly ſay ſome <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Aue,</hi> and then they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke about, and if occaſion be, they prate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34971:17"/>
againe, and perhaps ſpeak of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours attire, or fashion, or of the prieſts behauiour, or preachers doctrine if it doth not pleaſe them; they goe to church, as it were but a bare ceremony, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing that holy action as they ought; and they whoſe ſex requires more modeſty, in the church, where it ought to be moſt, doe shew but leuity and vanity, litle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and no recollection, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are very Pious. in short, though theſe caualliers and ladyes, ſeeme to be of ſome capacity more then others, yet they ſo forget them ſelues, and their duty to god; that they may be without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, compared to the Iewes, who kneeling <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 29.</note> before our Sauiour, adored him in ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; and then laughing, looked on each other; in like manner, theſe ſay ſome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, careleſy (which is to vnderualue our Sauiour and litle eſteeme him) and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily they turne faces about, prate, and ſmile at each other; and they doe ſcarcely leaue off, at the very eleuation, which is no ſooner donne, then they are vpp, and prate againe. I leaue it to their cenſure; (this conſidered) whether it be not a foul abuſe, a great irreuerence and diſreſpect to that great god of glory; their creatour and redeemer?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34971:18"/>
9. Many alſo frequent the churches and Sacraments, that they may not be noted to be cold Catholiks, or indeuout; and many tymes, when they ſee others of their quality communicating, not hauing thought of confeſſion till then, without any great ſorrow for their ſinns, or due preparation, they confeſſe and receiue; this is a great abuſe; diuers other abuſes in this kind. I omit, leaſt to be tedious, returning to what I ſaid in the begining; that whether the prayer be vocall, or mentall, without that eleuation or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the mynd to god, it is of lirle, or no profit at all.</p>
                        <p>10. For, who going to treat with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of fashion about ſome weighty matter, by which he intends to benefit himſelfe, would not court him the beſt he could, or at leaſt, giue him that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as well in conuerſation, as ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which to him is due, according to his quality and calling? much more to a King when a petition is to be preſented to him. For it is knowen in all kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, with what low ſubmiſſion and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and with how many bowings or conjues, he is firſt ſaluted; before the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition be deliuered; and then how obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant the petitioner is, of the kings ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34971:18"/>
whiles he reads it, how carefully doth he fix his eyes, to ſee when he will looke at him, and how attentiuely, and patiently doth he expect his anſwere; Be you now iudg deere Chriſtian in this caſe, whether a wrong be not donne to the king of kings, and lord of all things, when by thoſe that goe to ſpeake and petition to him, he is not ſo much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as a temporall King, or worldly man of a meane degree: for they ſcarſe begin to pray, when moſt irreuerently they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne (as we may ſay) their backſyde, to his diuine Maieſty, who is there preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to giue audience, and heare their requeſt: their mynd buſily ſpeaking with the world, and he left as a Cyphar there quite forgotten. O foul abuſe? o great ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerence<hi>!</hi> o vnſpeakeable ingratitude<hi>!</hi> my God how canſt thou endure it? my deereſt Lord, how do'ſt thou bere with ſuch rude, and vngratefull people? Verily thou art the God of patience, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the meaneſt man of any fashion would not take the like affront at any others hands, though ſom what beyond his degree. O true louer of our ſoul's, what canne they expect by ſuch prayers, or I may better ſay, by ſuch mockeryes? for though thou art moſt mercifull and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34971:19"/>
gracious, and very willing to receaue our petitions, and grant what we deſire; if we come to thee with that humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and true confidence, which is fitting, and all ought to haue in thee, or with that very reſpect, and attention which they afford euen to thy creatures. when (I ſay) thy ſo great goodneſſe and mercy are not regarded, (but they diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme thee ſoe much, and turne their hearts and mynds from thee) and the day of reckoning come; doubtleſſe thou wilt turne thy bleſſed face from them, and they may heare to their coſt; depart from me yee curſed into hell fire for euer. which is an excluſion from the ioyes of heauen, and the ſight of Gods glory eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                        <p>11. I beſeech thee therefore, my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull lord, that thou wilt peruent this ſo great euil, and grant us moſt fraile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, thy holy grace in this life, to forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this great irreuerence, and continuall abuſe of thy diuine Maieſty, in tyme of prayer, which through negligence and inconſideration, we commonly fall into, that thy ſweet face may not be turned from us, at the hour of our death, nor we be forſaken by thee for all eternity. Amen.</p>

                        <head>THE 2. CHAPTER.</head>
                        <head type="sub">How to pray with profitt.</head>
                        <p>1. FIrſt deere ſoul I would haue you vnderſtand, that in conuerſation with God (for prayer is no other thing) neither rethoricall eloquence, ſubtilty of witt, or great learning, is requiſit, but a plaine, humble, and ſimple declaration of what you intend; for his diuine Maieſty vnderſtands our intention: therefore it will be fitting, whenſoeuer you go to prayer, to haue a certaine intention, or to propoſe to your ſelfe, ſome end, for which you intend then to pray, that your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer may not be in vaine. As for example; I will go to prayer, to giue God thankes, for his many benefits beſtowed on me; as for my creation, redemption, and ſuch like; and in token of gratitude, I will ſay ſuch prayers, or ſpend ſo long tyme at my deuotions, or heare one maſſe, or more: or I will confeſſe and receaue this day, in vnfained thankfullnes, for the loue which our Sauiour did bere towards me, coming from heauen to earth, to ſuffer what he did, in his life and death, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his heauenly father, for the ſinns of ſuch a vile and baſe wretch as I am. and then purpoſe through his grace, to ſerue and loue him euer after, with more fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34971:20"/>
and ſincerity then formerly; and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his holy aſſiſtance and grace to that end: alſo at other tymes to obtaine true ſorrow, repentance, and forgiueneſſe of your ſinns; likewiſe amendment of your life, or the ouercoming of ſome vice, or paſſion, to which you are muſt inclined; or to gaine ſome vertue; as patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, loue of your neighbour, chaſtity. &amp;c. moreouer you may apply your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for the ſoules in purgatory, your frends and parents that are dead; in like manner for the conuerſion of ſinners, the neceſsityes of our holy Mother the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or for any other thing, that is commended to your prayers, or you intend to obtaine of his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty; for ſurely it is much ſimplicity and ignorance in any, to go to prayer, and ſpeake wirh this ſo great a king, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Lord, and not know what about, nor conſidering to what end.</p>
                        <p>2. Therefore going to prayer (which is, as I ſaid, to ſpeake to that great King, and lord of heauen and earth) remember allwaies to doe and direct it, for one of the former ends, or the like; which don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in the place of prayer, ſuppoſe in your mynd, that god is there preſent very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly (as truly he is) accompanied and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34971:20"/>
attended with many quires of Angells that are allwayes prayſing him with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable reuerence and loue: and that he is then there, to giue you audience, and know your intent, and requeſt. After this with great ſubmiſſion and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, addreſſe your petition to dis diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Maieſty, by ſome deuout prayer, or if you ſay your beads; ſay, my God I offer this prayer, or paire of beads, to thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty for this end, (naming for what,) lookeing ſweetly on him with the eyes of your mynd, or inwardly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that you are ſpeaking to him. And though the prayer be in latine (which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me rather vſe) and that you vnderſtand it not, yet becauſe it is appointed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Holy Church, inſtructed, and directed by the Holy Ghoſt, for the vſe, and ſpirituall good of the faithfull, and that you ſay it, with an intention, and deſyre to honour and pleaſe God, in that act: his diuine Maieſty will accept of it moſt gratefully, and doubtleſſe will grant you your requeſt, or that which you pray for; for he lookes into the heart, and the deſires thereof; and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des more the intention of the mynd, and the affection where with you pray, then the words which are pronounced; in ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34971:21"/>
much, that let the prayer be neuer ſo ſweet in the vulgar tongue, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to his diuine Maieſty, with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect, it pleaſeth him not, and auayleth you litle or nothing.</p>
                        <p>3. So that let the prayer be in latine, or vulgar tongue, God doth not regard, the language, but the intention of the heart. wherefore you muſt allwayes ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to haue your mynd well applied (as is ſaid) and for ſome particular end, when ſoeuer you go to prayer; and in caſe through frailty, or ſome ſuggeſtion of Sathan, you be diſtracted, ſo it be not willingly admitted, by reaſon of your firſt good, direction, intention, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, your prayer will not be void of merit; but be carefull, in prayer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſome tymes on what you doe, and how you pray, and if you find your mynd wandering, and not applyed as it ought; with humility cry God mercy, for that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerence, your negligence and diſreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, acknowledging your frailty and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>releſſneſſe, in theſe or the like words. My God, thou ſe'eſt my frailty, inconſtancy, and negligence, and how eaſily with vaine thoughts I am taken away, which plainly shew my litle loue to thee, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue me my good God, and giue me the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34971:21"/>
aſſiſtance of thy holy grace, that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I may apply all my thoughts, and mynd on thee alone<hi>:</hi> this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in prayer, is very pleaſing to his diuine Maieſty; and belieue it, he will not deny, what you ſo deſyre, or grant you a better thing; for which end, you may alſo craue the aſſiſtance, and mediation of thoſe celeſtiall, and moſt gracious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teours, which are about him, for they doe highly reioyce, to ſee their Lord (whom they deerely loue) reſpected and honoured; and they will not faile to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his diuine Maieſty to grant what you ſo humbly and earneſtly shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or deſyre.</p>
                        <p>4. This is the true way to pray with profit, and it will bring you with facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to mentall prayer; for in deede vocall prayer ſo vſed, is both vocall, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; and certainly God doth concurre particularly with thoſe that giue them ſelues to prayer, granting them, not only many inward comforts and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo ſuch an exemplary life, that they are obſerued, and beloued by moſt people. for the inward grace cannot but manifeſt it ſelfe, in their outward workes, ſo that you may ſee them often viſiting the Churches, hearing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34971:22"/>
and diuine ſeruice; frequenting the Sacraments with much deuotion, ſpending long tyme in prayer, with ſo great inward feeling, that often out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the teares aboundantly ſlowe from the inward ſweetneſſe; they read good bookes, to keepe in, the litle fire of deuotion; they are alſo full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, workes of mercy, and charity, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and corporall, they endeuour as neere as they canne to keepe a pure and cleane conſcience, and are deſirous to ſerue, pleaſe, and praiſe God in all things; and thus they are inflamed with diuine loue. I could wish that there were many more of this ſort; then there are; doe you your endeuour to be one, for his grace will neuer be wanting to a willing mynd, and then remember me.</p>

You ſee, that to doe this, is but a ſmall and eaſy thing; and you may ſay it, in your mynd, which none but God, who knowes &amp; ſees the ſecrets of all hearts, canne obſerue, to whom certainly it will be very acceptable, and to you merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and profitable; for in making this short act, there is no labour, trouble, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, or auſterity; but this direction may be practiſed, with great ſweetneſſe and facility, by euery Chriſtian, poore and rich, great and ſmall, ſick and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, in all occaſions and affaires, and it is to be taught to children, euen from their infancy, for the vſe and dayly practiſe of it, will make it pleaſing, and eaſy; and it being ſo ſmall a matter, though great before God, none canne excuſe himſelfe from performing this litle in Gods ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſaying, I haue no tyme, by reaſon of my many occaſions and affaires, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas, ſo few words my be inwardly ſaid in the very going, or acting any buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe what ſoeuer.</p>

10. For in the moſt ſerious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that canne be, they may remember, to thinke once of God in their mynd; neither ought they ſo to employ them ſelues in worldly affaires, as wholy to forget God, being created to ſerue him in this life. which if they doe, in the other, they shall enioy him in glory, for euer; and for thoſe that doe very litle or no ſeruice to his diuine Maieſty, the leaſt they ought to doe; is, to offer vnto him a deſyre, to ſerue and pleaſe him, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting (as is ſaid) what they doe, by ſo few words to his honour and glory, or wishing in their heart, that they could pleaſe him; which is quickly donne without paine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer this hath an other benefit; for beſyde the merit of thoſe acts, they preſerue the mynd, from thoſe which are euil and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Alſo they diſpoſe a man, and keepe him myndfull, to reſiſt his paſſions, if by chance in occaſions he find him ſelfe moued; and withall they procure a quiet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34971:25"/>
and pure conſcience, and a ſtrict frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and familiarity with God, this is a bleſſing and happineſſe, to thoſe only knowen, who by vſe therof, haue the delightfull feeling of it; there is none ſo ignorant or dull, but may practiſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo few words, and ſo eaſy.</p>
                        <p>11. But they that can ſpare tyme, may remaine longer in prayer, both morning and euening, then they, whoſe occaſions doe not aſtord them that benefit; and commodity; and for their comfort, it will much auayle, to read, or heare a chapter of the life of Chriſt, his ſaints, or of ſome other ſpirituall, and deuout booke, gathering thence, ſome pious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument, wherein to employ their mynd, and moue their affections to God, who is allwayes preſent (as is ſaid) looking on, and conſidering what wee thinke and doe.</p>
                        <p>12. Note alſo, that when you read, any pious thing, you muſt not runne it ouer, as a horſe galloping in haſte, but slowly, and attentiuely, with a deſyre rather to be moued to deuotion, the loue of God, and other ſpirituall affections, then to know, through curioſity, what it is, or what is contained in the booke; which is a cammon temptation of the deuil; for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34971:26"/>
when in reading, one is moued inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the holy ghoſt, to deuotion; he ought to reſt in it, and go no further; but Sathan who allways watcheth to hinder our good, doth edge vs on, to read more, and more, vnder a pretence, of getting greater knowledg, and to be more moued to deuotion but in the meane whyle his intention is, that the inward motion of deuotion, may decay, (leaſt by it, any ſpirituall profit might be gained) and when you think it will continue, and that you may haue it, when you pleaſe, by too much reading you shall find your ſelfe dry, and voyd of any good motion, by reaſon you did not accept, and make good vſe thereof when he gaue it.</p>
                        <p>13. VVe read, to be moued, to deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if we gaine it; what neede wee ſeeke further, till we haue fed on that, it being our ſpirituall foode? we find, that when S. Francis had any holy inſpiration, (though trauailing) he would deſire his compagnion, to go on a litle before, and he did ſit him downe, till he had eaten that holy bitt, by due conſideration, and ſome pious affection, with thankes to his diuine Maieſty.</p>
                        <p>14. Therefore, in reading, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; inſtantly shut the booke, or lay it a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34971:26"/>
ſyde; then ruminat, or quietly conſider in your mynd, what you read, and to what in particular you are moued; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly make ſome act of vertue; as for example, being moued conſidering that by your ſins, you often offended God, and deſerued his diſpleaſure, endeauour to be grieued, make an act of contrition and deſyre God to pardon and forgiue you. if you are moued to the loue of God, conſidering his benefits, and loue to you; endeuour to be thankfull, makeing acts of gratitude, and deſyre his holy grace, that you may ſerue him more ſeriously euer after, then formerly; and ſo of other things; this is the manner to read with merit, and profit, and it will delight the mynd very much, and induce the ſoul, by degrees, ſweetly to take content and ioy, in ſpirituall things, and the ſeruice of God; this is a neceſſary digreſſion from my firſt purpoſe, and a profitabile ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.</p>
                        <p>15. Now returning to what we left; and ſuppoſing that your affaires were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and diſpoſed according to your occaſions and ſtate of life, till dinner ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; then, be take your ſelfe for a litle ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to the oratory, or place of prayer, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re briefely, deſyre God to giue you light,

that end, from heauen to this world) is prepared for you; and that they be moſt happy, who are now ſitting with him in glory, at that ioy full, and endleſſe feaſt; therefore with true affection, wish hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, that yow were there among them.

                        <p>17. VVith theſe, and the like good conſiderations, you shall feede your ſoul

ſpiritually, as with theſe meats you feede your body corporally; and allwayes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke rather to ſatisfy nature, that you may be able to ſerue God, and performe the dutyes, and obligations, of your ſtate; then in any wiſe; pleaſe your taſte, or ſeeke ſenſuality, and delightfull guſt, in eating and drinking; then dinner ended, and grace ſaid, recreat your ſelfe, with ſome indifferent paſtime, and honeſt conuerſation, for an hour; or goe about your houshold, or other worldly affaires, as your occaſions shall require, directing all, to God's honour, and glory, as is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid; and if you canne afford ſo much tyme, in the after noone, you may read, ſome chapter, as is ſaid for the morning.</p>

and ſuch as poſſibly canne be, are contayned, may be ſeene, and enioyed; ſo that man's capacity and deſyre, not being able to goe further, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, be thereby ſatisfied, and fully ſet at reſt, with all, endleſſe content, and ioy; which is his bliſſe. o happy and high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of man, who is created for ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and Noble an end; as not to reſt nor be truly ſatisfied, with any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to God, who alone canne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly giue him all content?</p>

                        <p>1. IN the former chapters, you haue ſeene, in what a noble condition, and for how glorious an end, man was created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet how Adam, and in him, all mankind; fell from that happineſſe, by ſinne, the breach of Gods command; and therefore, were iuſtly condemned to death, and hell. it reſts now, to conſider,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34971:46"/>
how, and by what meanes, man was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and free'd, from ſinne, and that eternall punnishment; for as is ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the greatneſſe of the benefit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well conſidered, and acknowledged; the obligation, and thankes, will be the more. But hitherto, we haue not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what ſinne, is; or wherein, it doth conſiſt; for thence depend the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our diſcourſe; and you may eaſily perceaue, how iuſtly, that great punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is deſerued, and by God inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>2. Sinne therefore, is a thought, word, or deede, againſt the law, or command of God; in which, thou art to conſider two things, the firſt is, an auerſion from God, the ſecond, a conuerſion to ſome creature; that is to ſay. to forſake God, and his loue; for the loue of a creature; which doubtleſſe, is a moſt grieuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and an iniury intollerable; being a contempt, and vnderualuing of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty, and goodneſſe of God.</p>
                        <p>3. For the ſinner doth attribuit vnto that creature, ſomewhat, more worthy of his loue, for that preſent, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit goodneſſe, of God; which is the compleat obiect of all loue, and from whom all other goodneſſe that is in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34971:47"/>
creatures, loue worthy, doth proceede, and depend; which is a great vnderua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of God, our creatour, of whom we haue our being; and therefore, ought to loue him, aboue all other things, what ſoeuer, as he commands vs, to doe, in the firſt of the tenn commandements, he infinitly exceeding all his creatures in perfection; and therefore, the more to be eſteemed, honoured, loued, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then any of them, yea, then they all together; and hence the offence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, is ſo much the greater, by how much he exceedeth them all, in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfection; neither were they, euer able to make due ſatisfaction, to his diuine Maieſty, for ſo great à cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</p>
                        <p>4. For the greatneſſe of the offence, and iniury, donne to any, hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and value, according to the quality, or dignity, of the party, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offended; there is none ſo ſimple, but knowe that it is a greater crime, to abuſe a Noble man, then a meane country man; and a King, then a Noble Man; the party, and perſon offended, by ſinne; is the great God, and King, of heauen and earth, of infinit dignity, maieſty, and goodneſſe; therefore the offence againſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34971:47"/>
this infinit perſon, is of infinit malice, which requires, an infinit ſatisfaction, to wit, of infinit value, this, no creature, could afford, being of a limited, and finit being, depending of an other, and this is the reaſon, why all their actions are of a limited value, and conſequently, their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction could not be proportionable, to the offence, being of infinit malice, as the abuſe of an infinit perſon; which conſidered; none canne admire, that God all omnipotent, ſo grieuouſly wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an iniuried, should condemne, the offender, to ſo great, and ſeuere a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                        <p>5. But what remedy, that this creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſo Noble, should not vtterly perish, (though iuſtly condemned) but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, from the ſlauery and tyranny, of ſinne, and Sathan; and then reſtored, to Gods fauour, and grace, in this life, and to glory, in the other? I muſt confeſſe, that the wotke is great, and hard; though nothing, is difficult, to loue, Therefore, that great God (whoſe nature is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and workes mercy, and whoſe mercy, farre Surpaſſeth all his other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes) ſeing man. (his owne likeneſſe, and image) in that miſery; was moued with tenderneſſe, of heart, and tooke
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34971:48"/>
compaſſion, on him; and there vppon, in that cabinet councell, of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, held in the great, and high court, of heauen; a way, and remedy, was found, that due ſatisfaction, should be made, and man ſet free, from his captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſlauery, and reſtored againe, to God's frendship, and a right, to endleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe glory; which was thus.</p>
                        <p>6. The ſecond perſon, of the moſt holy Trinity, the true ſonne of God, through loue, did offer himſelfe, for the glory of his heauenly Father, and the ſaluation, of mankind, to become man; and in our flesh wherein his Father, was offended, and in our behalfe, to make condigne and full ſatisfaction, to his Father, for all the ſinns of the world; by his holy life, bitter Paſſion, and painfull death on the croſſe; for he was equall to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as the iniury, was of infinit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, becauſe donne, to an infinit perſon, ſo the ſatisfaction, was infinit, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from an infinit perſon; to wit the ſonne of God, whoſe workes, were of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>finit merit, and value; this being conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, and agreed vppon, in that diuine councell; at, and according to the tyme determined, and appointed, from all eternity; the ſonne of God, came into
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34971:48"/>
this world, became man, taking on him, our human nature, and moſt graciouſly, and louingly, without any deſert of ours, by the meanes aforeſaid', made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, payd, our debt, free'd vs, from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hell, and Sathan; reconciled vs to his heauenly Father, who was offended, and with the price, of his Precious Blood, did purchaſe, the kingdome, of heauen, for vs; made vs, coheires, with himſelfe, of that moſt happy country, of all felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, true ioy, and life euerlaſting. by which, you ſee, how true, and louing a frend, our Sauiour, Chriſt Ieſus, was, and ſtill is, vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>7. Nay more then ſo, knowing how fraile, and apt we are to fall to ſinne, and how ſtrong, and full of wyles, the deuil is, to deceaue; that we might not perish, if by chance, we should fall, he prouided, and furnished vs, with all neceſſary hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and meanes, to riſe againe, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and encourrag vs, with alacrity of ſpirit, to paſſe the dangerous way of this our peregrination, and come at length, to the ſafe port, of eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. for beſide preachers and teachers, to inſtruct, and direct vs, their godly bookes, to comfort, and helpe vs, their exemplary life, to encourage vs, and

                        <p>8. And more then ſo; for the greater expreſſion, and manifeſtation, of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection, towards vs; and to make vs confident, of his loue, and aſſiſtance, in all afflictions, and difficultyes, which by the intiſements, or malice, of our enemyes, may occurre; He left, him ſelfe, <note place="margin">

Then remember, how heerby, he hath prouided euerlaſting glory, for thee, in his kingdome; exalted thee, to a higher dignity; and made thee more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble farre, then thou wert formerly; for though thou wert created, to Gods like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet inferiour, to the Angells, by nature; but now, thy nature, thy flesh, and Blood, is placed, aboue them all, at the right hand, of God the Father, in thy Brother, Chriſt Ieſus; who is created, Lord of the Angells, and appointed iudg of the liuing, and dead; which is a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, farre ſurpaſſing all Angelicall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whatſoeuer.

O Lord I am very wicked, and thou art the Saint of Saints, God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, creatour of heauen and earth, men and angells; and wilt thou ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and demeane thy ſelfe, as to come to me, a vile and baſe worme of the earth, worſſe then nothing?</p>
                           <p>13. O my God, and only good; will it not be a digrace, and dishonour to thy dignity, and highneſſe; to come to ſuch an vnworthy: and abiect a houſe as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne? O diuine loue, and goodneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible; I doe confeſſe that thou art delighted to be with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; which makes thee long ſo, to come to vs; not for any profit or gaine to thee; but for our good, and to worke in vs, the ſaluation of our ſoules. But o Lord, I find my ſelfe wholy vnworthy, that thou should'ſt enter into my houſe; ſay but the word, and my houſe will be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34971:61"/>
glorious, my heart purified, my ſoul ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and replenished with all grace and happineſſe.</p>
                           <p>14. O Lord of mercy, pardon me, for thus expoſtulating with thee, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting thee; ſince it is thy will, to come to me; o life of my ſoul, thy holy will, be done in me, and of me for euer. Yet I wish that I had more then angelicall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſeraphicall loue, that I might in ſome degree, be worthy, that thou should'ſt come to me. but true it is, my deere Ieſu, that thou do'ſt therefore co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to me, to make me worthy; and then thou wilt reioyce to ſee me pure, and take delight to be with me for euer.</p>
                           <p>15. O true louer of mankind, thou did'ſt inuite thy ſelfe, to the houſe of litle Zacheus; and he, and all his family, got ſaluation by it; to his greateſt ioy and comfort; ſince then it is thy pleaſure, to come to this poore cottage, of my ſoul; come my Ieſu, and I will giue thee the welcome of a thankfull heart; and as thou ha'ſt made it for thy ſelfe; if thou pleaſe to take content therin, I shall haue happineſſe for euer.</p>
                           <p>16. O my deere Ieſu, come vnto me, who am more thyne, then myne; leaue me not to my ſelfe; poſſeſſe thy right,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34971:62"/>
enioy thy choyſe; and I moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſo to ioy in me, that I may ioy in thee; and ſo diſpoſe of me, that I may be ſoly reſerued for thee. O Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the ſeruants, (my ſenſes) to watch and be carefull, that no other lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be admitted in, but thy ſweet ſelfe alone; keepe this my ſoul, for thy houſe of pleaſure, and garden of delight: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me my God, come vnto me, I doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thee; and when thou art come, my deere and heauenly ſpouſe, ſo fyre my heart, and burne me, with thy loue; that I may be wholy transformed into thee; and after this mortality, enioy thee in endles felicity; Amen.</p>

Hauing receaued this your bleſſed gueſt; follow him, with all your powers, and ſenſes; recollecting them, within your ſelfe, where he is; and there caſting your ſelfe, at his ſacred feete, with S. Mary Magdalen; adore him with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſubmiſſion, acknowledging, that you are a wicked ſinner, hauing very often, offended his diuine Maieſty, and therefore vnworthy of his holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; craue pardon; and reſolue to dye rather then offend ſo louing, and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne a Lord, who hath vouchſafed to viſit you of his owne goodneſſe, without any merit or deſert in you.</p>
                        <p>3. Alſo you may make ſome acts of faith, confeſſing that he is there with you, really and truly, God, and man; who

was borne of the B. V.

At other tymes, hauing receaued, his diuine Maieſty; offer your ſelfe, body and ſoul, with all your powers and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to him humbly, deſiring him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of you, and take you to his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diſpoſe of you, as of his owne; and that if you had ten thouſand liues, all should be his, and at his diſpoſall; ſpeake inwardly to him with confidence, and reuerence as if you had ſeene him with, your corporall eyes before your face; for ſo certaine, he is there preſent; aske forgiuneſſe of your ſins, and grace, neuer more to offend, and that you may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the paſſion, or vice to which you are moſt inclined: then humbly beg that, for which in particular you did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat.</p>

5. This done, make good reſolutions, and firme purpoſes to amend your life, shun the occaſions of ſin, and with his holy aſſiſtance, to loue and ſerue his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty better then euer before; and dayly to doe ſome particular exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to put you in mynd of your reſolution and purpoſe; though it be but to ſay one Aue Maria when the clock ſtrikes; then pray for your parents, frends, the ſoules in purgatory, the Catholick Church, dayly increaſe of grace, faith, hope, and charity, and ſuch other things, as you pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>6. But I haue obſerued ſome, more ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, then pious, who after receauing, or maſſe ended, inſtantly get away, diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſelues, to idle conuerſation, and worldly affayres, not giuing than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, for that fauour, or viſit, nor once conſidering, the greatneſſe of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; whereas the great God of glory, King of heauen and earth, came to them in proper perſon in that bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to shew his loue, and doe them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſpeciall fauour, if they had but giuen him the welcome of a ioyfull heart, with thankes.</p>
                        <p>7. Theſe vngratefull chriſtians, by that meanes doe depriue themſelues of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34971:64"/>
many graces, and a true feeling of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty's holy preſence within them; for his coming would not be in vaine. beleeue it certainly, he comes to heare our praiers, ſupply our wants, and grant what we demand, or what is more fitting fot vs. he is not ſo bad a gueſt, as not, to be regarded, for truly he will pay very well for his lodging, and intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and abundantly reward the very leaſt act, or curteſy which shall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or done vnto him. this they find, who with humility doe reſpect, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, for they haue a perfect feeling of his holy preſence and loue; by the effects, which they perceaue, and doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in them ſelues, as, a tenderneſſe, of heart, through loue, ſweet teares, and deuout ſighes, for their ſinns, inward content and comfort; with true deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a delightfull ſatisfaction, in all their powers; great deſyres, to ſerue and pleaſe his diuine Maieſty, more then euer before; a ioyfull ſpirit, with many good reſolutions, godly inſpirations, and other effects, (which for breuity I heere omit) by which they dayly increaſe in grace and vertue, and the loue of God.

8. Therefore let this be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and after receauing reflect on what you did, and whom you haue preſent, and why, or for what end, you did then communicat, and receaue him; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes doe as is formerly ſaid, for, (deere Chriſtian ſoul,) if in your mynd, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>n.</hi> 2. 3. 4. 5.</note> you can conſider this, or that worldly buſineſſe; and what is beſt to be done in it; why not that, which tend to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or ſaluation of your ſoul? alſo if you can diſcourſe with men, of worldly things, and giue them reaſons for what you ſay, and doe; why not with God, your louing Lord and redeemer, who is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of your company and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is then come of purpoſe to heare and know, your petition, and what you pretend, or demand, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to ſupply all your wants?</p>
                        <p>9. Moreouer, for your comfort, you muſt vnderſtand, that his diuine Maieſty know's our condition and weaknes, and therefore requires no eloquence of vs; ſpeake to him in your owne language and manner, be it neuer ſo plaine and ſimple; he will excuſe you, and accept of your good deſyre, being offered with humility and reuerence; and in caſe you cannot diſcourſe with him inwardly, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34971:65"/>
mentally, for want of vſe; you may ſay mentally ſome of thoſe deuout prayers, which are in the 15. or 16. chapters, yet very ſlowly and feelingly; looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly on him, to whom you ſpeake; which will procure a reuerentiall reſpect in your ſoul.</p>
                        <p>10. But ſome may ſay; what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that we ſo often receauing the very treaſure of heauen, the fountaine of all grace, and goodneſſe; our deere Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus (who ſo much deſyr's our good and happineſſe, as his coming from heauen, his life and death for vs, doe teſtify) are not rich in vertue, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in loue, forward in deuotion, and prompt to ſerue and pleaſe his diuine Maieſty in all things? To this I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; and doe conceaue the reaſon to be; that we doe not prepare, nor diſpoſe our ſelues as we ought; neither haue we a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely faith, of his holy preſence within vs when we receaue; and thence doth follow, that we haue not that eſteeme of him, which he deſerues and requires of vs; nor that reſpect which is due vnto him; and conſequently we haue not that confidence in him, which is fitting, and he doth expect from vs. for if we did verily beleeue that we receaue him who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34971:65"/>
is omnipotent, mercifull, willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our offences, and receaue vs lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly vnto his grace and fauour againe, and doth but expect, that we giue him the occaſion to beſtow his bleſſings and benefits vppon vs, (by a good prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a reuerentiall receauing, a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petition with confidence, that he will not fruſtrat vs, of our deſyre being more forward to grant and giue, then we to aske and take) without all doubt, we shall obtaine not only what we petition for, but alſo other graces and fauours, which we neuer thought of, and were farre beyond our capacity, to demand; this we ſee and know by dayly experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, in thoſe who proceede in his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with true ſincerity.</p>
                        <p>11. For if the ſoul be pure and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deſirous to pleaſe and honour his diuine Maieſty: at his coming, he will dilate her heart, and make her daily more and more capable of diuine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, giue her a greater inward recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a deeper impreſſion of his loue; and ſo by degrees eleuat her beyond herſelfe, with great ſweetnes to high perfection, she not knowing how. for as the infant ſucking his Mother's Mylke, is nourished, and increaſeth dayly not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34971:66"/>
perceauing how; euen ſo, the pure and humble ſoul, as a new borne child (as the Apoſtle ſayes) often receauing and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that diuine Milke, and drinking of thoſe celeſtiall fountaynes (the ſacred wounds of our Sauiour) the water and nourishment of life in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, is ſweetly nourished, ſtrengthned, and dayly increaſeth to a great ſtature and perfection of grace and vertue; that not knowing how, she finds herſelfe, not to be what she was, but quite an other, in her life, manners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, recollection deuotion, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, heauenly deſyres, contempt of her ſelfe, and the vanityes of this world, for the loue of God.</p>
                        <p>12. I doe therefore conclude, adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that you prepare your ſelfe careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is layd downe in the tenth and 11. Chap. and after a good confeſſion and receauing, to keepe your mynd emplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed, (as I haue ſaid aboue after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) and more recollected all that day, then you doe, on other dayes; for you muſt often conſider whom you haue within you, and what a bleſſed gueſt he is; to whom, it is fitting you should giue attendance, and the welcome of a glad heart with many ſweet and vertuous
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34971:66"/>
acts, which will not be vnre warded and allwayes be carefull to communicat for ſome particular end, or intent, if you meane to profit.</p>

                        <p>1.

                        <p>2. But by reaſon of our inclination to euil, (which we haue from Originall ſinne, which in baptiſme is taken away) we are fraile, and weake to do good, and obſerue the commandements of God, Therefore to ſtrengthen vs (in tyme of temptation) againſt all euil, the world, the flesh and the deuil; and like wiſe if through frailty we should fall, it will be very requiſit, that we of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>3. Moreouer, to moue and incite our ſelues, to frequent thoſe bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will be very fitting and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, that euery day, we conſider, that we muſt dye; and perhaps this will be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt day of our life: and if we be in ſin, and depart this world, in that caſe; what shall become of vs for all eternity? we muſt then reſolue, to doe now, what at the hour of death, we should haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to part with a pure conſcience in the grace of God; which is had by thoſe holy Sacraments; this is the beſt and ſecureſt preparation.</p>
                        <p>4. Likewiſe, that you may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared, in ſudden occaſions, and tyme of dangerous fits; you will doe well in tyme of health, to haue your will, or teſtament written, ſigned and ſealed in your daske, or with ſome frend; for in your ſicknes it will be a comfort to your mynd, that it is made; otherwiſe, when you ought to think vppon god, and the

eternall ſaluation of your ſoul, then will your frends be earneſt with you to make your will, which perhaps may ſo trouble you, that you may forget to diſpoſe your ſelfe for God, and ſuddenly dye vnprepared; as I haue ſeene ſome doe. and euery yeare you may ad, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish what you pleaſe, in it, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent thoſe inconueniences.</p>

and ſtill do'ſt offer all thy ſacred pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and wounds, vnto him in ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and remiſſion of our ſinns; that with thy Precious Blood, all malice was hed from our ſoules, and thy true charity ſtilled into our hearts, we might affect, truly loue, and with thee, pray for our enemyes, and perſecutors; ſaying; Father forgiue them, becauſe they know not, what they doe.</p>

Thy loue o deere Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, is great to vs, and therefore thou do'ſt inuite vs, to come to thee, to be vnloaden of the heauy burden of our ſinns, and be forgiuen; yea, it is ſo vehement and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that with a tender and louing heart, thou do'ſt excuſe our weakneſſe, frayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vnconſtant condition; and eaſily do'ſt forget our faults, and put them in obliuion; yea if our ſinns be vnnumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we, as foul as may be; from the croſſe, thy voyce is made horſe, calling vnto vs, to returne from our wicked wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, and come to thee; thy bloody foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines will wash all cleane away; thy holy armes, are ſtretched out, to embrace

                     <head type="sub">Of the dignity, and profit of Mentall Prayer.</head>
                     <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt part, you haue ſeene, how, and with what great profit, the ſoul may delight her ſelfe, with the vſe, and practiſe of vocall prayer, and other pious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and become gratefull, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God. But in this part, you walke by a more perfect way, and of a higher merit. for in that prayer, you ſpeake to God, as a farre of; and in this prayer; as to one neere vnto you; giuing eare, to your diſcourſe, or petition; or, as one familiar frend, with an other, in great priuacy or ſecrecy; vocall prayer, is vſed often, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any particular attention; but this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34971:119"/>
prayer, requires attention, and a ſerious application of the mynd inwardly, or it is no prayer. In this, when the ſoul gets within her ſelfe, she begins to diſcouer the ſtrang workes of God, which are in man vnknowen; but to thoſe that are by God illuminated; in this, as in a looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe, a man diſcouers, what he is, and cometh to the true knowledg of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for there he ſee's, how farre, he is from true chriſtian perfection.</p>
                     <p>2. This knowledg of our ſelues, is the ground, and fundation of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life and edifice. In this, a man finds out, what vices and paſſions, doe moſt dominier, and moleſt him; and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, why he doth not liue, in all things, according to the law of God, and the right rule of reaſon; and what remedyes, to apply, to this great euil. Heere all the inward ſores, diſeaſes, euil cuſtomes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and diſordered affections are perceaued; this is the ſchoole, where we may be dayly taught, and inſtructed, how to cure thoſe ſores, ſuppreſſe thoſe vices, mortify thoſe paſſions, regulate thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and inclinations; gaine vertue, and pleaſe our heauenly ſpouſe;</p>
                     <p>3. Heere, we come to know the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, vnconſtancy, and vncertainty, of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34971:119"/>
the things, of this tranſitory life, with a cleerer ſight, and feeling, then euer befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; which cauſeth the ſoul, to loath, and contemne the world, hate vice, loue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſeeke after God alone. and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore she reſolues to chang her life, and be no more, what formerly she was; her eyes, are opened; she is illuminated, and taught, in this prayer, how all things created canne giue her, no true content; which makes her ſeriouſly deſyre, and aſpire, to thoſe things, which are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</p>
                     <p>4. For she begins to taſte in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, of the content, and ioy of mynd, which the true ſeruants, of God, enioy in heauen; now she regards not the wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of this world; but that which doth conſiſt in ſubiection, humility, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of life.</p>
                     <p>5. Nay more then ſo; in this prayer, the wyles, and deceits of the deuil, and the ſubtile and alluring excuſes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, are diſcouered; which are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to a ſoul that deſyres true perfection; which muſt be had by the way of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; which the deuil, and nature doe litle affect. heere, the knowledg, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of God, increaſeth to a great height, in the ſoul; which his diuine Maieſty,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34971:120"/>
doth often viſit, and replenish with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall graces, and comforts, and by ſecret influences of his Holy Spirit, doth eleuat her farre beyond her ſelfe, to ſee, know, and feele with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ioy, what, tongue cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</p>
                     <p>6. To conclude; in this prayer we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to a true vnion of our wills, with the will of God; which is the higheſt we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne attaine vnto, in this life, by our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and induſtry, through his holy grace; without which, we canne doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; though many has great fauours, viſions, and reuelations, by his ſpeciall gift. O what a happy thing this prayer is? o what a ſweet inuention this is, of our good God, to bring ſoules to his knowledg, loue, and familiarity? (as is ſayd in the begining) that thereby, with more facility, and ſecurity they may gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that glory; for which they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this, all ought to loue, deſyre, and practiſe; that deſyres endleſſe felicity, and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>7. Many there be, who thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, or at leaſt, of great difficulty, to attaine to, or gaine, this bleſſed prayer; but I doe aſſure them, that they are very much miſtaken; though true it is, that it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34971:120"/>
cannot be had, without ſome induſtry, and labour of ours; neither canne a man learning any art; or ſcience, be perfect the firſt day, be it neuer ſo eaſy; for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth all; we ſee thouſands, of all ſortes, and ſexes, giuen daily to this exerciſe, and practiſe of mentall prayer; ſo that, if you intend to goe forward in this holy exerciſe, and acquire perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you muſt not think it difficult; nor be diſmayed, if preſently you gaine it not; for euery thing, hath a begining; and nothing is had in this world without labour<expan>

and of greater value, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, then their's.</p>
                     <p>9. Be not therefore disheartned, but as the Prophet ſayth; come, and taſte of it, that is, practiſe it, and you shall ſee, and feele, how ſweet and pleaſing, our Lord, is, to thoſe, that through loue, doe truly ſeeke after him; For, if you be in <note place="margin">

                     <p>1. MEntall prayer, as I take it, is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, yet reuerentiall collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, conference, or humble diſcourſe of the ſoul with God, not by outward words, but inwardly, in our mynd; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our neceſſityes and wants; and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch things, as we ſtand in neede of; for to this; all our diſcourſe tends; this definition of prayer, includes and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the other, which is an eleuation or application of the mynd to God: for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34971:122"/>
I muſt firſt haue a man preſent, befors I canne ſpeake to him; euen ſo, I muſt firſt, haue God preſent by the eleuation, or application of my mynd, to him; before I canne diſcourſe, or ſpeake with him. But you may inquire how you may haue God preſent; I ſay; his preſence is framed by your vnderſtanding, as you shall thinke fit, or moſt conuenient, for your purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; as our Sauiour, being a child, in the manget, shaking with cold: or as a man praying in the garden, and ſweating wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Blood; or in any other forme, or manner, that he liued, on earth; is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in heauen, or in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, where he is really, and truly, God and man; or by faith, ſuppoſing him to be within and without you, as truly he is, according to his diuinity; which is euery where, in all things, and in the moſt inward ſubſtance of your ſoul, and ſecret, of your heart; alſo when you are diſtracted, or not well able, to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe his preſence, in your mynd. you may pray inwardly, looking on ſome deuout picture, or image placed before you to keepe you recollected. ſee the 11. chap. of the preſence of God.</p>
                     <p>2. To the end therefore, that you may proceede orderly and not confuſedly, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34971:122"/>
this prayer; obſerue the method, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner heere ſet downe; by which, you may diſpoſe your ſelfe, with due reſpect, to appeere before, and ſpeake with ſo high a Maieſty; and ſpend the whole tyme of prayer with eaſe and profit; this doth conſiſt in the vſe of the partes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>3. The partes of prayer are ſix; to witt, Preparation, Leſſon, or reading, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thanks giuing, oblation, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is properly prayer. Euery part of theſe, hath its owne office, and is of great importance, to be well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and obſerued.</p>
                     <p>4. Preparation, hath two partes, the fiſt, remoues all outward impediments; as to expell, out of your mynd, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſecular affaires, vaine and idle thoughts, and ſuch as are not of God, or tending to piety and deuotion; the other, procures an introuerſion, and recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the powers and ſenſes, now free by the firſt, from worldly, and vaine obiects<hi>:</hi> that all being at reſt; the ſoul may more ſeriouſly, and attentiuely, apply her ſelfe to her negotiation with God, with whom she intends to treat, of high matters, as the buſineſſe of her ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is; which requires a carefull,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34971:123"/>
and diligent application, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.</p>
                     <p>5. For a man that hath many employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, knowing that at a certaine hour, he is appointed to haue audience of his Prince, or King, (which he much deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) about affaires of great conſequence, will ſomewhat before tyme, rid him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of all other employments, ſo to diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe him ſelfe, without trouble, for that hour of audience; this is the firſt part; but this is not ſufficient, for it is not enough, to rid himſelfe of thoſe occaſions, if he did not recollect himſelfe to conſider ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refully, what he is to doe, and what to ſay vnto the King. this is very plaine, and reaſonable. he therefore hauing ſet a ſyde all occaſions, as is ſayd, he retyres him ſelfe into his chamber, or cloſſet, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing direction, to his ſeruants, or way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not to permit any come at him, leaſt they diſturb him; then he there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth himſelfe ſeriouſly, to conſider, the greatneſſe and maieſty, of the perſon, he is to ſpeake with; the manner how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himſelfe, and ſalute the King; and the mattet, or buſineſſe, he is to ſpeake of, with him: in this the mynd is totally applyed in recollection, and this is the ſecond part of preparation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34971:123"/>
6. In like manner, the hour of prayer; is the hour appointed for you, to get au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſpeake with your King; the great King of Kings, and Lord of all things; a quarter of an hour, or more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that tyme, you muſt endeauour, to put all diſtractions, and idle cogitations (as is ſaid) of what kind ſoeuer, out of your mynd; for with theſe you are often to much employed, and buſyed; this is the firſt part; to shunne company, rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re your ſelfe, to your chamber, and read pious and godly bookes, helpeth much to this part.</p>
                     <p>7. Then enter into the cloſſet of your heart, with all your powers and ſenſes (as is ſaid) and there conſider, the dignity of the perſon, you are to ſpeake with; the manner, how, and the matter, you muſt ſpeake of; As for example; thus. I am shortly to haue audience, and ſpeake, not with a worldly man, but with the true King, and creatour, of heauen and earth; that great God omnipotent, who giueth being, and life, to all creatures; in whoſe ſacred preſence, the Angells, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, and Seraphins, and all the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall powers, doe tremble, and shake; if then, to worldly Kings, there muſt be ſo many ceremonyes, bowings, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34971:124"/>
vſed, before a man, canne ſpeake to them, as we dayly ſee; what muſt be donne, and what ought I to doe, going to ſpeake with my God; the King of ſo great power, dignity, and maieſty, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moſt gloriouſly, with many quires of Angelicall ſpirits, whoſe eyes, will be all together vppon me, obſeruing what paſſeth? doubtleſſe then, I muſt come before him, with great humility, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect; and ſo behaue my ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, that I may doe nothing, diſpleaſing to his diuine Maieſty, or offenciue to his heauenly courteours. and this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of preparation.</p>
                     <p>8. Then, the matter which you art to treat, or diſcourſe of, being reſolued vppon; at the hour appointed, and in the place of audience, to wit, of prayer, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with great reuerence, ſay ſlowly and feelingly, the following Antiphon. and prayer.</p>
                     <p>9. Come o Holy Ghoſt and fill the hearts of thy faithfull, and kindle in them, the fire of thy loue.</p>
                     <p>The verſe. Send foorth thy Spirit, and they shall be created.</p>
                     <p>The reſponſory. And thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, the face of the earth.</p>

                        <head>Let vs pray.</head>
                        <p>10. O God who by the illuſtration of the Holy Ghoſt, ha'ſt taught the hearts, of the faithfull; grant vs, by the ſame ſpirit, to vnderſtand righteous things, and of his conſolation, allwayes to reioyce. through Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>
                        <p>11. Then with great ſubmiſſion, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re his diuine Maieſty ſay mentally. O what am I, or how dare I preſume to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to thy preſence, my God, and King, of infinit Maieſty, and glory? for I am nothing, but duſt, and ashes, meat for wormes; and which is worſe; a wicked ſinner; who often offended thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, thy wrath, and indignation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any fauour; which makes me, with feare, and trembling, now appeere before thee.</p>
                        <p>12. But becauſe thou art goodneſſe it ſelfe; and as well, the God, and Lord, of ſinners, as of the iuſt, (hauing all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer both; and art very deſirous of the good, and ſaluation of all thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, being infinitly mercifull; and can'ſt forgiue, more in an inſtant, then I haue donne, or euer canne commit) with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34971:125"/>
a moſt humble and ſubmiſſiue heart, yea, with shame, and confuſion, I doe come to thee, o moſt mercifull, and great God of glory; being a grieuous ſinner, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to amend my life, and neuer more offend thy diuine Maieſty; wherefore I humbly beſeech thee, not to caſt me from thy preſence, but giue me audience my deere God, and incline thy eares and heart, my gracious King vnto my words, and heare what I shall ſay: for I will not deſpaire, but confide in thy mercy and goodneſſe, and doe humbly begg of thee to grant me thy grace, that I may truly open my heart, and make the cauſe of my ſoul knowen vnto thee.</p>
                        <p>13. Theſe or the like words of your owne, you may vſe; Then read in ſome pious booke, or call to mynd, the matter which you red before, and did prepare, and intend to ſpeake of, ſo poſſeſſing your ſelfe of the quality of the buſineſſe by reading; which is the ſecond part of prayer.</p>
                        <p>14. Then beginne the third, which is Meditation; by which you doe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that matter or ſubiect, with all its circumſtances, and conueniences, as how it was, is, or may be, for your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, and profit; what, and how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34971:125"/>
great a benefit it is, to you; or you may get thereby, and what obligation it doth caſt vppon you. As for example, ſuppoſe that the matter read of, and you are to conſider, or meditat vppon, is, how Chriſt our Sauiour being ſtript naked by the Iewes, is faſt bound to a pillar, moſt pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully whipt, his ſacred flesh torne with many heauy lashes, and his whole body, blody all oner; this you frame in your mynd; and him in this caſe placed before the eyes of your ſoul, adore, ſaying quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlowly in your heart; who is this ſo pittifully tormented and torne? this is my Sweet Ieſus, whom the Iewes did ſeeke to put to death.</p>
                        <p>15. O Ieſu art not thou the ſonne of the Eternall Father? art not thou the glory of the Angells, the ioy of heauen, the louer of mankind, and the innocent lambe, who came to ſaue thy people, and take away the ſinns of the world? art not thou o my Ieſu, as well God as man? how come's it then, that thou art thus abuſed and tormented by curſed ſinners, the wicked Iewes?</p>
                        <p>16. Looke on him in that pittifull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, with a tender heart and a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat eye, and reſt in that ſweet aſpect, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout more words, as long as you canne;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34971:126"/>
for ſo, you may be eaſily moued to ſome deuotion, inward feeling, or pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; in which you may remaine, repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and delight your ſoul, with that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall guſt, vntill your affection begin to decay; and if you may ſpend the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>17. For the end, for which we meditar, is, to moue the will, to ſome good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which once had; meditation, or diſcourſe is needeleſſe, and will rather hinder, then profit the ſoul; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in any pious affection doth ſpend the tyme very profitably.</p>
                        <p>18. But if you be not moued, or the affection groweth cold; go on with your meditation or diſcourſe thus; O Lord how ſpitefully are they ſtriuing, who shall abuſe thee moſt, ſtrike the greateſt ſtroke and put thee to moſt torment and paine? and, conſider that when they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue reſted a while they begin againe, as it were in your preſence; and what oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and iniurious words they ſpeake vnto him, laying, heauy lashes, on euery ſyde; and not as much as one, to fauour him, or take compaſſion vppon him; then lookeing at him; reſt in that ſight,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34971:126"/>
as is formerly ſaid, (without forceing your head, or heart: for all violence or force, in this ſort of prayer, doth hinder the ſpirituall profit, and hurreth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health,) and if in this, you get no feeling, or your deuotion, or affection (if any you had) doth decay, ſuppoſe that our Sauiour deſolat, all alone, among that wicked crew, is lookeing after an eye vppon you, with teares trickling: downe. Then addreſſe your ſpeech vnto him, ſaying.</p>
                        <p>19. O my deere Lord, I ſee thee forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by thy Apoſtles; and left to the cruelty of thy bloody enemyes; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to attend, or comfort thee; In what, my deere Ieſu, canne I ſerue thee? it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues me, to ſee thee (who art the beauty of heauen) in that deſolat and wofull caſe; I will my God, remaine heere, and will not part from thee; that, at leaſt, I may be partaker of thy inward griefe, if I cannot be of thy outward paine; I wish my God that I could be ſome content or comfort vnto thee, who art the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my ſoul;</p>
                        <p>20. Theſe or the like words, may be inwardly ſaid, very feelingly, not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor haſtely; but ſlowly and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely; that the ſubſtance, of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34971:127"/>
or ſaid; like water into a ſpunge, may ſoake into the inward depth of the ſoul; which will cauſe her, with great alacrity of ſpirit, to continue long in prayer; or it interrupted, to returne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to it againe; which is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;</p>
                        <p>21. I muſt confeſſe, that the content, which in meditation of his Holy paſſion, is often had, is very great: but am ſory, that ſo few, haue a feeling of it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they doe not vſe this ſort of prayer; nor try how ſweet our Lord is, to all that through loue doe come vnto him. But if in what is ſaid, you are not moued, nor find any guſt; goe forward in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſaying vnto him, as yet lookeing vppon you; my deere and louing Lord, I ſee thy affliction, to be great; I beſeech thee let me know, for what, or for whom do'ſt thou ſuffer thoſe grieuous paines, and torments? for paine and punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are due deſerts of ſinne; thou neither did'ſt, nor could'ſt ſinne; neither craft nor deceit was found in thee. why then, or for whom, wert thou ſo cruelly tormented?</p>

I deſerued punnishment; and not thou; but I ſee, that what I could endure, were no ſatisfaction for my ſinns, being of infinit malice, deſeruing infinit pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: therefore, to ſet me free, from all; thou ha'ſt taken the punnishment on thy ſelfe (through loue) which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from thee, and offered vnto thy heauenly Father, is of infinit value and ſatisfaction; and thus thy painfull ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is for me.</p>
                        <p>23. O life of my ſoul, what am I? or what is there in me, worthy of thy loue? that thou, the Sonne of God, and Lord of heauen and earth, should'ſt ſo ſuffer for me? O purity of the Angells, my ſinns, haue put thee to that paine; my ſinns haue ſo tormented thee; by that great punnishment, and thy painfull wounds, I ſee how hatefull to thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, my ſinns are; who ſo ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely doth punnish them in thee, his only, and deerly beloued ſonne; O curſed Caitiffe, o wicked wretch, that I am: who haue ſo ſinned; woe is me, who liued to

O deere Ieſu, what shall I doe? what shall become of me, who haue ſo wickedly tormented thee? o what shall I doe for that louing ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thyne, made for me? if in this, you haue any ſweet guſt, or feeling of ſorrow, compaſſion, or tender affection; reſt, as is ſaid, in it with content.</p>
                        <p>24. This donne, conſider that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour by his ſuffering, made ſatisfaction to his heauenly Father for your ſinns, and the great torments, which in hell yow were to ſuffer for them; which is a great and ſpeciall benefit, that ought to moue you, to take compaſſion vppon him, to hate ſinne, doe pennance, and be very thankfull to his diuine Maieſty for his loue: in ſuffering for you: and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a great obligation to ſerue him, euer after with more fidelity and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he hath caſt vppon you, procuring your ſaluation with ſo great paine mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely of his goodneſſe and loue: without any merit or deſert of thyne.</p>

28. The next part of prayer in order, is thanks giuing; for when you perceaue (by what you haue meditated) that you receaued a benefit, from God; ſtand it not with reaſon that you should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg the fauour; but alſo giue him thanks, in the beſt words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions you are able, or canne make your thankfull mynd knowen? which may be thus donne; o Lord, my God, the true louer, and moſt faithfull frend, of my foul; when, or how shall I be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto thee for all thy gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and gifts? and for this particular benefit, beſtowed, and donne vnto me poore ſinner, wholy vnworthy of thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue? O my deere Ieſu, how shall I requite this thy tender affection? o how shall I ſerue thee? or wherein canne I pleaſe thee? Oh how shall I praiſe thee being what I am? o how shall I honour thee, my God, who ha'ſt ſo highly expreſt thy loue, and deſyre of my ſaluation, in this great benefit?

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34971:130"/>
doth wound my heart, it is ſufficient to draw vnto thy loue, all the hearts of the children of Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for my part, I wish my deere and louing Lord, that my heart were wholy inflamed with the fire of thy diuine loue; that I might neuer reſt from praiſing and louing thee, and being thankfull for thy ſuffering thus for me, what my wicked ſinns iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued?</p>
                        <p>30. Therefore I beſeech all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of heauen and earth, in my behalfe to be thankfull vnto thee, and praiſe thee my God for all eternity. O comfort of my ſoul, deere Ieſu, I wish I had as many hearts burning with more then Seraphicall loue, as there euer were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are, shall, or canne be; all which, I would moſt willingly employ, in louing, praiſing, and giuing thankes vnto thee, for this thy louing benefit. O ſupreame goodneſſe, true life of my life, thou art the treaſure of heauen, and thy merits doe infinitly exceede all loue and praiſe of thy creatures; therefore I humbly pray, that thy owne goodneſſe, and all thy other attributes and perfections, in my behalfe, may praiſe thee, and be thankfull to thy ſweetſelfe for euer and euer. thus endeth thanksgiuing.</p>

31.

and heartely conſigne vnto thee o moſt louing and bountifull Ieſu. to be only employed in thy loue and ſeruice euer heereafter though I should ſuffer death it ſelfe thereby.</p>
                        <p>33. O deere loue the ioy of my heart and ſoul; I doe alſo offer vnto thee a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me purpoſe, and reſolution, for thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, to abhorre, and mortify in my ſelfe, what ſoeuer I shall know to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto thee; but chiefly this vice, and paſſion (name it) which I am inclined to; and with the aſſiſtance of thy holy grace, had rather dye and be torne in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then once giue way to it; or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy diuine Maieſty in that, or any other thing what ſoeuer. and to this end, I doe reſolue to take on my ſelfe, ſome pennances; and in particular, this weeke to faſt one day, or more, on bread and beere, and to diſcipline my ſelfe once, euery weeke, for this moneth, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe my ſelfe in this vertue, (name it) which is contrary to my paſſion, or vice; by makeing dayly, ſome acts therof; that with ſome token of gratitude though it be but very litle, I may shew my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to requite thy loue.</p>
                        <p>34. For I doe know my God, that good reſolutions and vertuous acts, are

But obſerue that no pennances muſt be vſed, (notwithſtanding your reſolution) without the aduiſe, or leaue of your Ghoſtly Father, or ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour, by whom you muſt be guided; for he repreſents the perſon of, God, to allow of, or not, what you reſolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, to doe for his loue and ſake. and thus endeth oblation.</p>

Now followeth the laſt part which is properly called prayer, that is, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for by this, we begg, and aske, as being poore and needy, of that great God, rich, and powerfull King, (whom we certainly belieue canne, and will grant our deſire) to helpe, and relieue vs in our neceſſityes, and beſtow what we are in want of as thus, My omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and moſt bountifull Lord, moſt mercifull and gracious King, (whoſe hands are allwayes open to the needy, and whoſe willingneſſe to aſſiſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, is greater, then their deſyre to be relieued, and without whom we are, and canne doe, nothing;) experience hath made me to know my owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, frailty, and vnconſtancy in any good; for I often fayled in performing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34971:132"/>
vertuous and godly reſolutions, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, for the amendment of my life; which cauſeth me humbly, to confeſſe, that of my ſelfe, I am truly nothing, and canne doe no good; Therefore my God, take compaſſion on me, leaue me not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelfe, grant me thy Holy Grace, to be conſtant in my good purpoſes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I shall fall, and ſlyde away, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe ſteps are not perceaued; my reſolution will fall to nothing, and I shall be as if I were not; hauing nothing whereby to ſubſiſt.</p>
                        <p>36. I am poore o Lord, and thou art rich, to all that will come vnto thee; I am in great want, and doe ſtand in neede of the aſſiſtance of thy Holy Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I am, which makes me o moſt bountifull, benigne, and Gracious king, heere proſtrat to adore thee with body and foul, in the preſence of thy holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and of all thy creatures, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that thou art all powerfull, creatour of all things, independent of any, and all depending of thee. all goodneſſe, is from thy goodneſſe; all power, from thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; all beauty, from thy beauty; all wealth from thy wealth; all loue from thy loue; all grace from thy mercy; and to conclude, without thee my God we are meerely nothing.</p>

37. Therefore I moſt humbly beſeech thee, and earneſtly begg, for thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy, that thou wilt commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat my caſe, and as thou ha'ſt graciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly inſpired, thoſe good purpoſes, and godly reſolutions, (for they are from thee, and not from me) ſo thou wilt be mercifully pleaſed, to grant and giue me, the particular aſſiſtance of thy Holy grace, that I may be thereby enabled, to amend my life, and through thy true loue, to execute, and performe, what I haue now purpoſed to doe for thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke; and principally to ouercome my euil inclinations, and vtterly abandon and forſake this vice of (A) by which I doe moſt offend thy diuine Maieſty, that heereafter all my thoughts words and deedes, may be highly, and purely to thy honour, glory, endleſſe praiſe, and my ſoul's ſaluation.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34971:134"/>
in this, you fight for gods cauſe.</p>
                     <p>4. When you find your ſelfe, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, that you canne hardly think vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any good thing; ſuppoſe in your mynd, that you are cauſe thereof; and therefore, with profound humility, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat before his diuine Maieſty, examin your conſcience, and likely you may find, that you committed ſome ſmall ſinns, or not prepared your ſelfe for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer; or not performed your good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or not anſwered ſome holy inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and if you find none of theſe; at leaſt acknowledg it, to be a iuſt punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the ſinns of your life paſt; and that you are truly, vnworthy of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, or heauenly viſitation, being ſuch, and ſo vngratfull a ſinner; and that you are more then well delt with all, to be admitted to his holy preſence. for this humility doth highly pleaſe his diuine Maieſty, and doth often moue him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to giue vnto the humble ſoules, great comforts, benefits, and graces.</p>
                     <p>5. Commonly you muſt vſe all the partes of prayer, in order; vntill you be well practiſed in them; by reaſon, in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of aridity, when you canne haue no guſt in one part, you may paſſe to an other; and ſo without trouble or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34971:135"/>
you may ſpend the tyme of prayer, if not with content and comfort; yet with profit. For as its ſaid in the begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, theſe partes of prayer, are placed before the ſoul, as ſo many diuerſityes of meates, that if in one she get no guſt, she may take of an other, and ſo taſting of each, it is like, she may get content and ſatisfaction, in ſome of them, pleaſe her pallat, and ſweetly refresh her ſelfe, after her long labour taken, in diſcourſing; ſeeking to find that ſpirituall foode. and be ſure to ſpend more tyme, in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue partes (which are the three laſt) then in the three firſt, which are only prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or diſpoſitiue; but as is ſayd, if in any part you be moued to ſome pious affection, remaine in it, without inward words, lookeing on the obiect, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it, as long as you canne; though it be in the very firſt<hi>:</hi> for God giues this feeling, perhaps in the begining, other tymes, in the middle; and ſome tymes, in the very laſt: but whenſoeuer it is giuen, eſteeme it very much, giuing hearty thankes<hi>:</hi> take ſufficiently of it, and be carefull, that your affection through too much feruour, doe not drowne, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway the vnderſtanding; for when it is vehement, with too great ſorrow, or ioy

(as is formerly ſaid) that all violence, or force, hurteth the body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the ſoul's ſpirituall profit, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her, to feare, and loath to go to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer; by reaſon of the paine she is put to, in that forcing. For faine she would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy totally what she loues; and she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her ſelfe to this, which cannot in this life be had, by all our endeauours poſſible; for it is not in our power, but muſt come by gods holy gift, when he pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>6. Alſo, if you be in any great aridity, or drineſſe of Spirit, doe not force your ſelfe; but in your deſolation, with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, acknowledg, your ſelfe vnworthy of any fauour, by reaſon it depends of the good pleaſure of his diuine Maieſty, and its beyond our reach, to haue thoſe comforts, and feelings; and eſteeme it a

ſpeciall fauour, (as truly it is) to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his holy preſence, on any tearmes to treat with him concerning, your reconciliation, and ſaluation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo often formerly offended, and wronged him: and giue him, very hearty thankes, for this fauour and benefit; this is the true way, and muſt be obſerued.</p>
                     <p>7. If through, weakneſſe, frailty, or negligence, you fall, or fayle in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your good purpoſes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome ſmall ſinns, or imperfections; be not impatient with your ſelfe, for this afflicteth many, troubleth the mynd, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth, diſmayeth, and deiecteth the ſoul, makes her forſake prayer, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes her from going on heartely in the ſeruice of God; a diſcontented and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mynd cannot pray well; Therefore in ſuch occaſions, let not your paſſion ſway, but with all ſubmiſſion go to his diuine Maieſty (who is more a louing Father, then a rigourous iudg:) confeſſe your frailty, and diſability, of which he is very ſenſible; and well knowes our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and will haue vs to vnderſtand and acknowledg it; and that we, of our ſelues canne doe nothing, but muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide altogether in our forces; and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce our whole truſt and confidence in

his omnipotent goodneſſe; who will giue vs the victory ouer our ſelues, if we be perſeuerant in our holy exerciſes, and his ſeruice; and not doubt of his aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and help: for he is ſo good, that ſeing your fidelity, and deſyre to pleaſe him, he cannot but reward it abundantly, though he differ's it for a while: Children learning to goe, doe get many falls, by reaſon of their weakneſſe; yet crying to the nourſe, with her help, they allwayes riſe againe: euen ſo, you are but a ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as yet, learning to goe in the way of vertue, and perhaps, you get many falls; then cry to God, your good nourſe, and with his holy aſſiſtance and grace; you may riſe againe as often? vntill at length, you may goe with out feare, or any great danger.</p>

or the like words; My God, I did not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hither, to pleaſe my ſelfe, nor to haue other conſolations, then to pleaſe thee; nor to doe my will, but thyne; if then, it be thy will, not to comfort me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but leaue me in aridity, I will with thankes content my ſelfe, and for thy loue, kneele heerein thy holy preſence, ſo I may therein doe thee, ſome ſmall ſeruice, which I hope my God, thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, when they cannot recollect themſelues, it will help to haue a deuout picture, or image before them, of our Sauiour, or ſome Saint; that looking on it, their thoughts may be employed, in the miſtery there repreſented; or this, or that thing donne by that Saint to pleaſe God; this will not only help recollection, but alſo moue to deuotion, ſweet teares, and a deſyre to follow and and imitat their example.</p>
                     <p>4. It will alſo at other tymes, help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, to haue ſome deuout booke (as our Holy Mother had going to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,) wherein to read, as often, as they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> vppon what they read; that ſo they may
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34971:140"/>
be inwardly employed vntill God of his goodneſſe, ſeing their diligent care, to pleaſe him, may either viſit them, with his holy grace, and giue them a feeling of his inward preſence, for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; or leaue them, in their aridity, and troubleſome thoughts, for their greater merit whiles they ſtoutly reſiſt them. for they fight for him.</p>
                     <p>5. It may likewiſe much auaile in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, when they know not what to doe, to runne ouer the life of our Sauiour, in a generall manner, from his infancy till his paſſion and death, only to keepe the mynd employed in good thoughts; and it is like that in ſome one part, they may haue a feeling of their, ſinns, of his loue, or ſome other good affection.</p>
                     <p>6. It will be alſo to good purpoſe, when they are troubled with many vaine cogitations; to think and conſider that God only is ſo powerfull, that with a word, he created the whole world; that he is alſo, infinitly wiſe, in creating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny admirable, rare varietyes of creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; and that he is vnſpeakably proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ordering and diſpoſing, ruling, and gouerning all with ſuch great harmony and conueniency that it ſurpaſſeth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding then to thinke on his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34971:141"/>
goodneſſe, mercy, maieſty, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; alſo of his great loue, to mankind, more then to the higheſt Angells; for he neuer did for them what he did for vs. thus to ſpend the tyme; going from one point to an other, will keepe one from idle thoughts; and delight the mynd in good ones, till prayer be ended. and if you canne reſt in any of them, offer your ſelfe to his diuine Maieſty, and shew a willingneſſe and readineſſe to pleaſe, and ſerue him, if you knew how, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wherein.</p>
                     <p>7. Moreouer our Holy Mother S. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea appoints a very good employment for a ſoul in this caſe; which she thus deſcribes; You muſt compare your ſoul to a young gentlewoman who is to be preferred to a husband; for firſt, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what his parents are, and what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and eſtate they are of; then she muſt know, what her husband is to haue out of that eſtate for their preſent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; alſo what condition and naturall diſpoſition the young man is of, with whom she is to be, during life; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she may conforme her diſpoſition to his. that with quietneſſe and content, they may liue together.</p>
                     <p>8. The ſoul is the gentlewoman, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34971:141"/>
be eſpouſed to Chriſt our Sauiour. she then may conſider who his parents are, what calling, and eſtate they are of, and what thereof shall come to thers share; his father is the king of heauen and earth, he is ſupreame Emperour of the world. he has a moſt vaſt eſtate; for all things belongs to him and he loues his ſonne ſo deerely, and tenderly that at preſent he has put him in poſſeſſion, and made him Lord of his whole eſtate, to rule and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all, as he shall think fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>: and as for his naturall diſpoſition he is ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, affable, beautifull, and amiable, that none canne be more. to conclude, there is nothing in him, but goodneſſe; he is voyd of paſſion, but full of vertue, and therefore his heauenly Father, muſt haue his ſpouſe to be of the like condition or at leaſt not vicious; but humble, louing and affable.</p>
                     <p>9. Then conſider, whether you may attaine to this ſo great a preferment? what may hinder it, and by what may you obtaine it, being of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for your aduancement? an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed and proud ſpirit, hinders it; for God cannot endure them; a humble and louing ſoul, is his choyſe; who then should not ſtriue to be ſuch a one, to purchaſe ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34971:142"/>
great a good, and a happineſſe which is eternall; a ſweeter louer cannot be, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kingdome or greater wealth there is none; more content and ioy may not be, then to be his ſpouſe, and liue with him, in endleſſe felicity; thriſe happy are they, who come to this bleſſed preferment; in this delightfull conſideration, the whole tyme of prayer, may be ſweetly ſpent. and as neere as they canne, all the partes of prayer muſt be vſed in their order.</p>
                     <p>10. It may ſerue well likewiſe, to ſay mentally ſome deuout prayers, chiefly the Pater noſter, Aue, and creede, with great attention; conſidering, briefely, what the meaning of this petition, or of what you ſay, may be; as; what is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by (our Father) then you are to conſider the condition or property of a good Father; and how louing and good a Father God is to you, that you as his child may loue and ſerue him in all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſo of the reſt: with this you may paſſe the tyme very profitably. Yet obſerue, that you muſt not commonly giue way to your imagination to runne vppon many things, but for the moſt part vppon one matter, or point of ſome miſtery; by reaſon the ſoul will gaine an euil cuſtome thereby, and be hardly well
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34971:142"/>
ſetled, or recollected in any wiſe; which is a great obſtacle to contemplation, to which we tend in prayer.</p>
                     <p>11. For you muſt vnderſtand that all the remedyes heere written, are only to be vſed in neceſſity, and in tyme of great aridity, and diſtractions; or when one cannot by reaſon of the want of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſettle in any one thing: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore theſe remedyes, are to be applied, to keepe the mynd ſo employed in tyme of prayer, that diſtractions may haue no place; ſo that the ſoul by the vſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of godly thoughts and the very powers and ſenſes, will take ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in that inward recollection; that of them ſelues, they will fall into it, in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of prayer; for the inward content and ſweetneſſe, proceeding from the knowledg of truth, and ſpirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, will allure them farre more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly then any outward things; many ſeruants of God, were ſo inwardly with their powers and ſenſes employed, that outwardly they made litle vſe of them; and that only for neceſſity, or charity; of theſe were S. Bernard, our Holy Mother Tereſa, and others; but howſoeuer humility, loue and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will gaine all; for where loue is,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34971:143"/>
it cannot be idle, and they who loue moſt; will labour moſt, for their beloued. the deſyres of ſuch as cannot helpe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with diſcourſe in prayer, are often great and many, to ſerue and pleaſe God, whom they loue; but wanting diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and vexed with. idle diſtracted thoughts, which they are continually reſiſting, they muſt ſuffer much, to paſſe the tyme, in ſome recollection; and in this they shew their loue, and doubtleſſe their merits and reward are great;</p>
                     <p>13. For he is ſcarſe worthy of than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that goeth often to prayer, when he canne paſſe the tyme with a ſweet and pleaſing diſcourſe, by which he may be eaſily moued to good affections, wherein he may be ſo contented that the very content and ioy of mynd, may keepe him recollected: but the other goes to prayer, with feare, and as to a torture, yea with great repugnance, the poore ſoul, loathing in a manner thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and troubles, which she is wont to ſuffer in prayer; yet for his ſake, whom she loueth, more then her ſelfe, she will not omitt her prayer; therefore his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Maieſty ſeing her fidelity and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, at length taketh compaſſion on her, and bringeth her to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34971:143"/>
and perhaps to quiet prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein she needes no diſcourſe, but with a ſweet repoſe of all the powers and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doe reſt with vnſpeakable ioy in the loue of her beloued; whom then she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth feelingly preſent in the inward of her very heart and ſubſtance; and this ioy is ſo exceſſiue great, that she eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes all her labours, more then ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded, though, they were as many againe.</p>
                     <p>14. It is to be noted, that theſe ſoules muſt endeauour to keepe great purity of conſcience, and often to frequent the Holy Sacraments of confeſſion, and communion; and it well be very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them to be practiſed in making acts of all vertues, but chiefly, of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contrition, patience, obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to gods will; and charity; by reaſon, in tyme of aridity theſe will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of diſcourſe and inflame the ſoul with loue, and godly deſyres, and cauſe her not feele the tyme paſſing, and at the end of prayer leaue her with content: if you pleaſe you may vſe at thoſe tymes ſuch iaculatory prayers as theſe:</p>
                     <p>15. My God thou know'ſt my diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ignorance in all that is good,

and that of my ſelfe I cannot haue as <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> much os one good thought, but all muſt come from thee; direct and teach me o Lord allwayes to deſyre to ſerue and pleaſe thee, and in all things, to fullfill thy holy will.</p>

                     <p>18. O moſt louing and amiable Ieſu, thou ha'ſt no good, by being with me; but all my wealth and health, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and only good, is to be with thee; by whom all goodneſſe and bleſſings comes to me;</p>
                     <p>19. Thou ha'ſt o Sweet Ieſu, ſuffered much for loue of me; why should not I ſuffer ſomewhat, for loue of thee? the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore I will kneele heere though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, to pleaſe thee my God.</p>
                     <p>20. O my Gracious Lord, thou ha'ſt endured many iniuryes and affronts for my ſake, o why my God should not I, (who deſerued all abuſes, and punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                     <p>2. A man that intend's to make a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34971:145"/>
for his pleaſure, of a plot of ground, ouer growen with euil weedes; putteth on a reſolution, (coſt what it may) to finish this worke, and bring it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. out of this reſolution he beginns to digg the ground, very deepely, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne it carefully ouer and ouer and to take away the weedes and rootes, leaſt they should grow againe; this donne, he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the clods, of earth, gathereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rootes, weedes, ſtones, and other rubbish, with his rake; and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one heape, he caſteth them all out of the garden plot; after this he begins to frame, and ſquare it, ſowe good ſeedes; ſet ſweet heatbs, and odoriferous flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; and plant it with faire pleſant trees; watering them all daily vntill they be well rooted<hi>:</hi> and then his greateſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is to keepe it cleane, and cut of the leaſt weede, that shall appeere; by which diligence and induſtry, the garden at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ngth comes to perfection; and the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, taketh great content and pleaſure, to walke therein, and is much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beauty and ſweet odours of thoſe flowers and hearbes; he makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegayes and gathers now and then, of the friute, and beſtoweth of them, on his neighbours, that they may partake of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34971:145"/>
the pleaſure and benefit of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>3. In like manner the ſoul of a man (who liued in the world, according to his owne will, and the deſyres of nature, is like vnto this garden plot, ouer gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen with the euil weedes of vice, bad cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, vnmortified paſſions, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered appetites. If therefore you intend to goe on in this holy exerciſe of prayer, and bring your ſoul to vertue, and true perfection; you muſt make a firme and ſolid reſolution, (coſt what it may) to apply all your deſyres, labours, actions, endeauours inward and outward, to that end only; ſo that the ſcope of all your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions muſt be, the acquiſition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and what shall appeere contrary to this, to abhorre and reiect, as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute euil, and impediment to your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt felicity, and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>4. This being ſo, the garden plot, to wit your ſoul, muſt be purged from all the euil weedes which she hath, as her euil habits, inclinations, and paſſions, as is formerly ſaid; and then, the ſweet and pleaſant flowers of all vertues there ſet and ſorted, will make the moſt pleaſant and delightfull garden that canne be imagined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:34971:146"/>
5. But how muſt this plot be purged? I ſay by being deeply digged, that is, by a ſerious conſideration, a diligent and exact examination of your life paſt, in thought word and deede, commiſſions, omiſſions, euil aduiſe and example.</p>
                     <p>6.

                     <p>7. Likewiſe examen what veniall ſinns, you doe dayly moſt offend God in, and whether your conſcience, doth reprehend you, when you commit them; or you careleſly paſſe them ouer, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no account of them; as in diſcourſe, to tell ſome light lyes for paſtime, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the ſtory; for it is an euil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if you haue no remorſe of your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34971:147"/>
ſinns, being they diſpleaſe ſo high a God, and doe diſpoſe a man to fall into deadly ſinns; and therefore carefully to be shunned.</p>
                     <p>8. Then conſider how vnmortified your paſſions and ſenſes, your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections, your proper will and iudgment, and all other your ſinfull wayes; were and are; for this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be more exactly donne, then that which they doe, who are in the world, (that intend only to ſaue their ſoules, confeſſing the greateſt, or mortall ſinns, not making any account of the reſt,) by reaſon theſe, aſpire to higher glory in heauen, and conſequently to greater purity, and perfection, heere on earth; and therefore they muſt examen the leaſt imperfections, as being impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to ſo great a good, which they pretend, and intend to gaine.</p>
                     <p>9. So that euery corner of this ſoul being ſo carefully digged, and turned ouer and ouer, and all the rootes, weedes, and euiles committed, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in your memory, by a good gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall confeſſion, to an vnderſtanding pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Ghoſtly Father, muſt be caſt out of this garden plot, which then may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſquared into a faire and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

garden, for the comportment and delight, of your heauenly ſpouſe and your ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>10. But it muſt be ordered by the good inſtruction of your Ghoſtly Father, Superiour, or ſpirituall directour; to whom you muſt be exactly obedient, not truſting litle or much to your owne ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, or wit in thoſe exerciſes, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments which he shall appoint; but with all humility leaue your ſelfe to be diſpoſed of, as God shall inſpire him, to direct you in all, that tend to your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good; and the acquiring of that perfection, to which by Gods grace, you reſolue and intend to attaine; and with great ſubmiſſion proſtrat before that great god of all goodneſſe, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre that he will be pleaſed to giue you, his poore and vnworthy ſeruant, a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knowledg of all ſuch things, as may hinder, and forward you, in this way of perfection;</p>
                     <p>11. For the vnderſtanding being illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, the will is eaſily affected; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King Dauid deſyred this gift of knowledg from God; giue me o Lord ſayd he, vnderſtanding, and I shall lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thy <note place="margin">118. <hi>Pſ. v.</hi> 73.</note> commandements, that is, I shall obſerue thy commandements; which we

For Dauid did not only caſt out of the garden of his ſoul, his great ſinns; but alſo he got vp commonly at midnight, to confeſſe vnto God; and did ſweepe cleane his ſpirit, from the ſmaleſt weedes and faults, that he found in it, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſeth in the 76. pſalme.</p>

                     <p>1. THis is the ſecond degree, to witt; that the ſoul be ſo ſquared and ordered, that she may be preſerued from euil weedes; and made fit, to receaue good ſeedes, hearbes, and flowers; The bleſſed Prophet King Dauid, who gaue vs, a patterne, or example of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in himſelfe; now giueth vs, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the ſecond; for nothing canne moue the heart of man, to forſake euil, and embraſe good more then the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the benefit of the one, and the hurt of the other.

fall to my lot, at the hour of my death, I know not; for the panges and paines of death are great, and what they will moue me to, is vncertaine, and the rigour and ſeuerity of god's iudgment, is ſuch; that he will haue vs to account for the leaſt idle word, thought, and deede; this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to carry in mynd, and keepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes, the eternall dayes, which are allotted for all; whether in hell or heauen, is to vs vnknowen; Therefore I haue cauſe to feare, and ſweepe my ſoul cleane, euen from the leaſt faults, as neere as I can, with the aſſiſtance of his holy grace; for I deſerued to looſe the one, and be condemned to the other.</p>
                     <p>2.

                     <p>1. THe ſoul, which is this garden plot, being by that good confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo purged, and made pure and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; and by thoſe good and pious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other holy exerciſes, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the directour or Ghoſtly Father, ſquared ſetled and ordered muſt now be; ſowen with good ſeedes, and ſet with good plants;</p>
                     <p>2. But perhaps you may demand, what are the ſeedes and plants, and where may they be had? to this I anſwere, that godly deſyres, and pious affections, are the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and all ſort of vertues, are the plants; and both are had in the faire garden of prayer, where you may walke freely, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the tyme ſweetly, and with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent parting, bring thence as many as you pleaſe, without feare of any; as for example, when you are in prayer, and with your vnderſtanding haue peruſed and conſidered how many and great the paines of hell are, and that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the eternall punnishment of

ſinners, by the great and powerfull Lord and King of heauen and earth, whoſe iudgment and ſentence none can shun; and that you often ſinned againſt this your King, and deſerued that punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be tormented in thoſe pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for euer, and conſequently depriued of the moſt glorious ſight of God, and the ioyfull company of his holy Saints and Angells; if you doe not repent whiles you haue tyme in this life; for after de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Out of this conſideration, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus; I am in danger, and in need: of Gods infinit mercy; o what shall beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of me for all eternity? hence you conceaue a wholſome feare, a hatred to ſinne, (which bring ſo great euil) a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull heart, a deſyre of amendment, a reſolution to make a good confeſſion, doe pennance, and neuer commit the like againe; alſo a purpoſe to acquire vertue, to ſerue, pleaſe, and praiſe God, who did expect your conuerſion with patience, giuing you tyme to repent, and grace to amend, and many other pious affections and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>5. You muſt heere obſerue, that in prayer, ſome, has good deſyres, but they doe not put them in execution; that is, doe not ſowe them, which makes them voyde of profit; as a deſyre to goe to confeſſion, and not to commit this or that ſinne againe; which preſently after prayer, they forget, neglect, or put of, from tyme, to tyme, and perhaps they are cut short by a ſudden and vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded death; for it is not ſufficient, nor enough, not to doe euil, but you muſt doe good; nor to forſake vice, vnleſſe you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and endeauour to gaine vertue; ſo that he who deſireth to be penitent, doe pennance, become vertuous, (as to be humble, modeſt, ſilent, and ſo of other vertues) and will not endeauour to put

                     <p>6. But what are the plants? and how are they ſet? to which I ſay; vertues, are the plants; and muſt be ſet in this garden of the ſoul, by the dayly vſe, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of their acts; ſo that in tyme; by this holy exerciſe, they will be brought to perfection; for experience teacheth, that by the often drawing of letters, and the vſe of writing, at laſt, a man writeth well; and by the vſe of ſpelling, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a man readeth well; and ſo of all arts; for by this practiſe, we gaine the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of arts; which doe facilitat vs, in their acts; ſo that by often producing vertuous acts; a, man gaineth the habit of vertues, and becometh vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by vicious acts, he becometh, and is called vicious; ſo that by the good, or, euil vſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, of your inward are outward ſenſes, you shall acquire good, or bad habits;</p>
                     <p>7. I beſeech you, call your fiue ſenſes to an account; which are the doores, by

                     <p>9. Marke alſo, how Dauid did cleanſe his garden, of this euil weede; and ſet therein the plant of modeſty: he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, confeſſed his ſinns, and then ſayd he, my God my, eyes did yeild floods of <note place="margin">

                     <p>10. All that, which conduceth not to deuotion, piety, the ſeruice and loue of God, is vanity; which, all intending to attaine to perfection, muſt shun care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Iob who knew fullwell the hurt of <note place="margin">

                     <p>11. If you then did offend, by the way of your eyes, or doe intend to preuent the future danger, imitat thoſe bleſſed ſaints, and ſet this faire plant of modeſty, in your garden; thus, in euery occaſion, of vaine showes, (as foolish masking, idle dancing, women's ſporting and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity) ſaying, o Lord turne away myne eyes, that they may not behold this vanity; part the place; and shun the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; or if you cannot; ſay inwardly; theſe obiects my God, are but vanityes, which diſtract my mynd, they are ſnares

of the deuil, to intrap my ſoul, I will not open myne eyes, I will not looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, leaſt I should offend thee my God, or fall from my good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>12. Farre be it from me o Lord, to place theſe eyes of myne which thou haſt created to behold thy infinit beauty, for euer in glory, vppon theſe fooleryes and vanityes, which are but tranſitory, and doe paſſe away as if they were not; to ſee thee o Lord, in thy glory, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, is life euerlaſting; o Ieſu, I will shut myne eyes to this world, that thou maiſt grant me this felicity; giue me o moſt modeſt Ieſu, this true vertue of modeſty.</p>
                     <p>13. By theſe and the like acts with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re taken, not to caſt your eyes heere or there, the maſtery and dominion ouer your eyes is acquired and this ſweet plant of modeſty, is ſet in your garden, and brought at length to perfection.</p>
                     <p>14. I haue ſeene in Collon, a certaine religious woman, of whoſe vertuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe I heard ſomwhat related; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in me a deſyre to ſee her, vppon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me occaſions I did obſerue her very well, and conſider her actions, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, which truly were very graue;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34971:156"/>
(though she was young) but aboue all, I did admire her modeſty, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of her eyes, which were ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and ſetled, that I could neuer ſee the apple or ball of either of her eyes; which did edify, and comfort me much; true it is that whoſoeuer has ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prayer, or a continuall inward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, can hardly moue their eyes, by reaſon of the inward attention, and ſettlement; this plant of modeſty, was well ſet, came to perfection, and was an ornament to her, and is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to others, who by her example may be animated and encouraged to imitat ſo rare a patterne; nothing is difficult to a willing and louing mynd; for the vſe and practiſe of any thing, be it neuer ſo difficult, maketh it eaſy at laſt; as we ſee in all trades.</p>
                     <p>15. As concerning your tongue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the ſame manner; that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſilence, may be ſet, as modeſty is.

                     <p>27. And if you ſee, that ſo beholding our Sauiours wounds, you are not freed; you may caſt your thoughts on the firy flames of hell, which many doe ſuffer there, for that ſinne; and ſay, O Who would endure willingly thoſe cruell fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes for euer, for a momentall pleaſure? o Lord, my God, ſend me all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, rather then come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

as long as you can poſſibly; for that will cauſe you forget the foul repreſentation, by reaſon our naturall powers, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the repreſentation of things, which are in our imagination, ſo that if the imagination be employed about any obiect ſeriouſly; it maketh her forget other obiects which troubled the ſoul;</p>
                     <p>29. And obſerue this well; that if you find a naturall proneſſe in your ſelfe to that ſinne, or did in your dayes formerly offend, in it; when you are in prayer, and doe conſider your ſinns paſt; neuer enter into any particular conſideration of the circumſtances of this vice; as how, or in what manner you offended? or how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, on ſmall occaſions, you offended God, in that ſinne? thinking by aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating the ſinne, and circumſtances, to moue your ſelfe, to more contrition, and greater hatred, to that vice. doe it not, for the deuil is cunning, and when you thinke to moue your ſelfe (by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the horrour of thoſe foul acts paſt,) to hatred of them, and more piety, he will moue you to carnality, hauing that occaſion, and well knowing your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition, and inclination to it; therefore though you had ſinned euer ſo much, in that Kind; call no particulars to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34971:162"/>
mynd; but in a round and generall way humble your ſelfe before God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that you offended in that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; make acts of contrition, deſyre par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and paſſe it ouer ſo. and if by that very generall memory of it, you find your ſelfe neuer ſo litle inclined, as is ſaid; inſtantly diuert your imagination, on ſome other obiect.</p>

                     <p>3. Wherefore you muſt not preſume to aſcend to this ſecond degree, vntill you be well examined; whether you are ſufficiently purged, from all affections towards the things of this world, well mottified in your ſenſes and paſſions, and come to the true knowledg of your
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34971:166"/>
owne inſufficiency, ignorance, vileneſſe, baſeneſſe, and nothing; for this is the ſcope and end of all the exerciſes of the purgatiue life; and then if your directour think it fir, you may goe forward to the ſecond degree;</p>
                     <p>4. But if you haue not your directour at hand, you may examine your ſelfe thus<hi>:</hi> firſt, whether you find in your ſelfe a true feeling, and knowledg, of your owne baſeneſſe, and nothing; and of Gods omnipotency, who alone can doe all things; and of whom, you depend, in your being, life, and whatſoeuer elſe you haue; then; whether out of this feeling knowledg; you eſteeme your ſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and belieue that you are to be ſo eſteemed, by all others; and whether you find, out of this knowledg of your baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and nothing, a holy hatred againſt your ſelfe, for offending ſo great and good a God; on whom you doe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: and whether thence, you would rather dye, and endure any torments then with deliberation venially offend, his diuine Maieſty; alſo whether you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that ſeruile feare, of hell, death, and iudgment to be much decayd; and that the meditating vppon them, is loathſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, by reaſon they make the ſoul too
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34971:167"/>
heauy, and penſiue; likewiſe whether you find your ſoul (in prayer) incline rather, to loue, then feare; and to conſider Gods benefits, then his punnishments; and whether you find a deſyre, to gaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by the imitation of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and a promptneſſe and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all that belong to the ſeruice of God; and a ſerenity, and freedome of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in your exerciſes. by theſe tokens, you may vnderſtand, and know that your ſoul is indifferently well purged, and made cleane; and ſo may paſſe, to the ſecond degree, or Illuminatiue way;</p>
                     <p>5. It may be well called the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue way, by reaſon the darke clowds of ſinne, are diſperſed, and the tempeſtuous winds of the vnmortifyed paſſions, which obſcured, blinded, and troubled the vnderſtanding, are now appeaſed, ceaſed, and decayed, by the exerciſe of the firſt degree. euery one knowes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that paſſion troubleth and blindeth the vnderſtanding; ſo that a man cannot ſee, or knowe well, what he ſaith or doth; neither doth he proceede then, according to reaſon; conſider a man or woman much in loue, or in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement paſſion of anger; and you shall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34971:167"/>
find, that they are ſo ouercome by the paſſion, that often, it ſeemes, that they are rather beaſts, then reaſonable creatures;</p>
                     <p>6. But now that the ſoul hath got ouer the hedg, from the foul miry way, wherin she was, into a dainty plaine, and from that winters night, to a ſummers day; and that the tempeſtuous operations of the paſſions, are gon; the vnderſtanding euen in his natiue light, doth now begin more ſeriouſly to worke according to reaſon, and chiefly, the ſunne of iuſtice, caſting his rayes and beames, in this ſummers day vppon him, by which he is enlightned, ſo, that he plainly ſee's and perfectly obſerue's the great miſery the poore ſoul was in; and that, only, by the practiſe, and exerciſe of vertue, she can be preſerued, and kept, from returning thither againe; then by degrees, this ſoul encreaſing in purity, by the exerciſe of this way or ſtate, gaineth a facility, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſweetneſſe in prayer, and many illuminations, and diuine illuſtrations, by which she is well inſtructed, how all that is in this world, is but vanity, and hath an end; and that only vertue and a godly life, hath endleſſe glory; for a rewatd; this cauſeth her to affect vertue, and really
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34971:168"/>
to ſet vpon't to gaine it;</p>
                     <p>7. But heere you muſt note, that though in the firſt degree, or purgatiue ſtate, acts of vertues are practiſed, as well as in this ſtate, yet there is very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the manner and motiue of both; for in the firſt; vertues are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, not for themſelues, or their worth; but in as much as they ſerue for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, mortification, or extirpation of ſome vice or paſſion; but in this; they are practiſed, deſired, and loued, for their owne worth, and excellency; which was vnknowen in the firſt degree, for want of that ſupernall light, which is had, in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>refore it is well called the illuminatiue ſtate, and the proficient; for the ſoul now takeing an affection to vertue, vnderſtanding its worth, with courage and alacrity of ſpirit, reſolueth to gaine it, (happen what may,) by the frequent conſideration and imitation of the life and vertue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Chriſt our Sauiour. and ſo by the dayly practiſe, and exerciſe of the acts, of thoſe holy vertues, she profiteth, and goeth from vertue, to vertue, vntill she hath gained a great profit, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the degrees of vertues, and of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:34971:168"/>
8. Therefore it may be well called the ſtate of the proficient, or thoſe that are profiting in vertue, and the ſpirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe; many other better reaſons you may find in diuers authours, or bookes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this ſubiect; but theſe at preſent, may ſuffice;</p>
                     <p>9. The firſt exerciſe of this ſtate, is, to keepe as neere as can be, a continuall preſence of God, as the fundation of all the reſt; the next, is ſolitude, or frequent retirement from all occaſions of diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; the third, the reading of good bookes, and vſe of much prayer; the laſt; the practiſe of vertues, by the imitation of our Sauiour, who ſaid', goe and ſell <note place="margin">

                     <p>10. The benefit of the preſence of God, is vnſpeakable, it preſerueth from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and cauſeth recollection, it diſpoſeth a man well, and helpeth to pray with eaſe, and content; it giueth courrag in difficultyes, and light to know truthes; it edgeth on to vertue; it moueth forcibly, to the imitation of good; it gaineth familiarity with God, and inflameth the ſoul with his diuine loue.</p>

                     <p>12. Thus, by degrees, this garden is dayly bettered, the ſweet hearbs and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re flowers brought to increaſe; for it is the office of this ſtate of life, to bring the ſoul forward in vertue and all piety; and with more heede and care, to preſerue thoſe plants, from the iniuryes of the wynd, and weather, as good gardeners doe; couering with earthen pots, glaſſes, ſtraw, and other things, the hearbs, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and fruit, which are precious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the weather grow warme, or be ſo

                     <p>13. Therefore you muſt place as a wall of defence, before them, the exemplar life of our Sauiour and couer them ouer with his loue, leaſt they should be nipt by the froſt of puſillanimity, and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the sharpneſſe of the wind; for when a temptation cometh, and nature, with the auſterity of theſe exerciſes, grow's cold in Gods ſeruice; then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting your eyes vppon the exemplar life of Chriſt, and that great loue of his to vs, couering all his actions, (as his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he being ſet at naught, and deſpiſed; his patience, being with many iniuryes and reproches abuſed, whipt, and ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and his perſeuerance in ſuffering; and the exerciſe of all vertues euen till death on the croſſe; and all for example and loue of you) inſtantly you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouraged to endure all, follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reiect all temptations, goe forward in your holy exerciſe, and neuer yeald to the excuſes of nature, nor deſyres of flesh

                     <p>14. For the Paſſions and inclinations of nature, are indifferently well morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſubdued; and therefore they doe not riſe in rebellion, with any vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and if they doe, the deuil ſo mouing them, ſuddenly by acts of the contrary vertue, as with a ſcourge they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as ſlaues, to be ſubiect, quiet, and at reſt: ſo that the deuil perceauing ſuch great care, and vigilancy, feareth to tempt, or moue any paſſion; becauſe he ſee's thoſe ſtout champions of Chriſt, gaine the victory, more and more, ouer them ſelues, and him, to his great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and thereby their vertue and merit to increaſe, which to him is no small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. and on the other ſyde: Chriſt our Sauiour, conſidering this ſo great diligence, and fidelity, of his ſeruant, he being the true ſunne of iuſtice doth shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

ouer all the garden of this ſoul ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, that she is wholy illuminated, comforted, and with the rayes of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue, ſo warmed, and heat, that the flowers begin to ſprout and shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and then one may be diſcearned from the other; as one, to be patience, an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other humility, and ſo of the reſt; ſo that the gardener finds in his ſoul vertues shewing themſelues, and without any pride, doth acknowledg it to be ſo; and that it is the ſpeciall gift of God, to whom he doth attribute all good, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and thankes; for he well knoweth, himſelfe to be a meere nothing, and all together vnprofitable.</p>
                     <p>15. But now that this gardener per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth thoſe faire flowers ſprouting, and shewing their beauty and goodneſſe, his whole mynd, runns vppon this; and he taketh no content, nor pleaſure but in walking in this garden, and delighting himſelfe with the faireneſſe, and ſweet odours of thoſe flowers. at one tyme he doth walke in the alley of humility; then, in that of charity; afterwards, in that of patience; ſo viſiting all; euery weeke making choiſe of one vertue, in which he doth intend to exerciſe himſelfe, that weeke; that ſo, he may bring them dayly

The ſoul perceauing this great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her Lord, and conſidering the vnſpeakable happineſſe, she may come vnto, by theſe meanes; deſyreth more and more to pleaſe him; and now to loath the things, of this world, which are but tranſitory shadowes; and to forſake vtterly all paſtime, ſecular compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conuerſation; her talke is wholy of ſpirituall things, and ſuch as tend to her ſpirituall profit, and the honour and glory of God; all that hath not this ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with it, is more troubleſome to her; then a moſt bitter potion to a ſtomack, that taking it, cannot be at reſt, vntill it be caſt vpp againe; and therefore to shun all theſe occaſions, she betaketh her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to more ſolitude and retyrement; and when there she call's to mynd her life paſt, and the tyme formerly ſpent in pleaſure, and vaine fooleryes, (which brought no profit, but much hurt and loſſe, vnto her, by them hauing offended this her deere and louing Lord, who is ſo gracious and good, as to make ſuch eſteeme of her, being ſo miſerable;) her ſorrow is great, her teares many, not ſo

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34971:173"/>
of heatt, ſweet teares, feruour, and delight in your workes, and a great facility to ouercome any difficulty, which then might happen, by reaſon of the ſenſuall guſt and ioy, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly feele; all this not proceeding from any acquired, or infuſed habit or gift, or the true loue of God; but really from that ſenſuall ſweetneſſe, which is agreeable to our nature, ſelfe loue, and proper intereſt; which is augmented by thoſe pleaſures and delights; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we willingly doe theſe exerciſes that our ſenſuall content may be the more; and thus the loue of our ſelues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per content, doth increaſe, and not the loue of God, or true vertue; and yet this runns on, very hiddenly, vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and colour of vertue, and the loue of God; which is a great hurt and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to our ſpirituall profit, and may bring many vaine Glorious conceits, illuſions, and deceits of the deuil to the ſoul.</p>

God in ſolid vertue, rather then for any content you find in thoſe guſts, which doe moue, vs often to force our ſelues, to things we cannot reach vnto; chiefly when they are from the deuil: as to make great reſolutions and purpoſes in that preſent content, to doe ſome great pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as it were for Gods ſake, which afterward we are not able to doe, or our nature cannot bere; which is but a trick of Sathan, to hinder our true ſpirituall profit; and by ſome difficulty occurring, or ſickneſſe, to put vs back from what we began, and intended; which was; with the grace of God to gaine true perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. to preuent this danger, we muſt with great humility, and ſubmiſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne our ſelues wholy to God, and ſtrip our ſelues naked from all affection to ſuch ſpirituall guſts; deſyring (without any proper intereſt) ſolid vertue for it ſelfe, and Gods glory: and to take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re content in croſſes and ſpirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, then in thoſe delights which doe hinder true vertue, and nourish ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe loue and proper eſteeme, being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

NOw let vs goe on in this matter of mortification to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the ſoul, for the former is in the ſenſitiue or inferiour part; God is wont to giue many illuminations, a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knowledg of truths, and great deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of true and ſolid vertues, to a ſoul, that doth vſe to mortify her ſelfe, and preferre his glory, and conformity of her will, to his, before that ſenſuall guſt or delight; and euen in this, the ſoul may glut her ſelfe; for the ſpirituall delight, which cometh with them, is without compariſon farre beyond that former, and therefore requireth more vigilancy, and a mortification, and renunciation, of a higher quality and order, then all that hath beene ſpoaken of; for, though thoſe illuminations, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from them, be from God, and really are a very good meane, to gaine ſolid vertue, and vnion of our will, with the will of God, by conformity and loue; yet

if we be not carefull; but giue way to our naturall diſpoſition, which is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to embrace ſuch illuminations, and ſpirituall comforts, with a great deale of inward ſatisfaction and content; we shall find as in the former, our owne will, and a ſelfe complacence (though hiddenly) in them. and then the ſoul doth ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to diſpoſe all her powers and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to dilate themſelues for augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe illuminations, and perſuades her ſelfe, that they doe increaſe, as her deſyre increaſeth, and that they are grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſees the ſoul to eſteeme this her owne complacence, more, then his loue, or conformity, with all indifferency, to his holy will; he doth withdraw this light, and his concourſe; ſo that she is left in aridity, and knowe's not what to doe for want of firme and ſolid vertue, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend's to nothing, but the pure will, and glory of God; and thus ſelfe loue shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theſe ſweet flowers, and hindereth them from ſprouting fairely, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, she cannot diſcerne the one, from the other, nor the true, from the falſe. But what remedy for this malady? what cure for this ſore? what euaſion, from this danger? partly that which is formerly ſaid, that when the ſoul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth theſe feelings in her ſelfe, and that great light, she muſt not deſire, to augment them; but with ſubmiſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat her ſelfe, and with true humility euen annihilat her ſelfe, acknowledging her vnworthyneſſe and nothing, before that great Maieſty of God, and that she is wholy reſolued not to pleaſure her ſelfe in any thing, but in doing his holy will, with all indifferency; and that by reaſon of her great vileneſſe, and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, she is vnworthy of any heauenly viſitation or conſolation, be it neuer ſo

                     <p>25. Thus she doth purify, her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reiect all ſelfe loue, proper compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and depriue her ſelfe willingly of Gods gifts and comforts, for God; and not only acquire firme and ſolid vertue; but alſo she thereby doth diſpoſe her ſelfe ſo well, that God often by ſpeciall influences, and purer light, doth lead her forward in the true way of perfection; and then this errour appeareth ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſoul, admireth at Gods grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

you haue your paſſions truly mortified, nor that you acquired any ſolidity in vertue, though your deſyres be great; and your inward acts of vertues, be many, and that you haue a great facility in the exerciſe, and doing of all things, that are to Gods honour and glory; vntill in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall occaſions, not ſo pleaſing to your humour, you be well tryed, and proued; for in the try all, the truth will appeere; and according as you find, you may prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God for his benefits, or humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg your frailty, and inconſtancy in good, if you failed, and found not in your ſelfe, that mortification, which you thought you had, and ought to haue; and aboue all, endeauour to ſubdue your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne will, and proper iudgment: for they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſo many wormes, will neuer leaue of grating on the rootes of thoſe vertuous flowers, be they neuer ſo faire; (if they be not very, well mortified;) and will neuer permit them come to perfection: be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore humble, and vigilant ouer your ſelfe, and implore gods grace, and aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, in euery thing; without whom, as you were nothing, and are nothing, ſo you can doe nothing that is good, nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any vice, or paſſion, nor acquire any degree of vertue; the manner how

                     <head type="sub">Of the Preſence of God, and what it is.</head>
                     <p>1. THis preſence of God, as I take it, is a memory of God, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the mynd, to God, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or conceaued by the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be preſent intellectually, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily; the intellectuall is, according to his diuinity; but this, according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. According to his diuinity, by a liuly faith, you conceaue him, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, eternall, immenſe euery where, in all creatures, and comprehending in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all things created, but cannot be comprehended by any; of whom all doe depend, and he of none; and that he is our creatour, begining, and finall end; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1 <hi>v</hi> 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Eph</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> the rewarder, and reward of all good workes; as the holy Scripture affirmeth; ſo that truly and really he is within you, and euery where, about you, where euer you ſit, ſtand, or goe; which you calling to mynd, and conſidering, is an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall preſence, of God, recollecting, and mouing the ſoul to great reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34971:183"/>
adoration, thanks, praiſe, and loue.</p>
                     <p>2. But when you conceaue him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his humanity, that is framing in your mynd ſome image repreſenting him, as he was a child, lying in the ſtable shaking with cold, or in his Mothers lappe, ſucking, or embracing her about the neck, ſitting among the doctours in the temple at twelue yeares of age, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the deſart forty dayes, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and teaching, curinge and helping the ſick, and ſore; or ſome particular point, or paſſage of his life, paſſion and death; repreſenting him thus, either wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hin you, before you, or at your ſyde, is an imaginary preſence of God. which you may eaſily vnderſtand by this example; when you call to mynd any frend, that is abſent; you frame his image, in your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and you ſee him, in a manner preſent; and ſo looking on him, with with your inward eyes, you may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to loue him; and ſome tymes, to grieue and lament for his abſence; Chriſt our Sauiour thus conceiued; is an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary preſence of God, and it is of great efficacy, to moue vs, to bewayle our ſinns, and to preſerue vs, from any, euer after; and to ſeeke after true vertue by his example.</p>

                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:34971:183"/>
3. The application of the mynd, to the preſence of God, may be diuerſly practiſed; firſt as one frend, with an other, taking content, that they are together; or as two in loue, much ioyed beholding each other, (their looke ſpeaking its owne language) ſo farre, that without other words, or actions, their hearts, are moued, their affection, inflamed; their ioy, increaſed; and being after this, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and one abſent from the other, they feele a ſadneſſe, a diſcontent, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe within themſelues; much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the ſoul beholding her beloued, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in mynd, (who is the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, amiable, and louing ſpouſe, that may be, and well vnderſtands the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion,) ought to take content, and ioy in his preſence, and be inwardly moued, and inflamed with his loue; this cauſe, being more noble, as being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt the creat our, and his creature; God, and man; the ſoul, and her heauenly ſpouſe; and as this loue, is farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, (as being pure, and ſpirituall) conſequently, the abſence of this her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, ought truly to make her ſad, and procure in her, a greater feeling of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, then that other betwixt worldlings doth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:34971:184"/>
4. Alſo you may not only take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in that preſence, and mutuall aſpect; which is the firſt degree, but likewiſe, you may come ſo neere as to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and conuerſe with him, expreſſing by inward acts, your loue, and willingneſſe, to ſerue and pleaſe him, in what you can; this is more forcible to increaſe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and if this preſence of God be of the humanity, and you beholding his wounds; how is it poſſible but you (kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that for loue of you, he was ſo wounded) will be moued to compaſſion, tenderneſſe of heart, and griefe, to ſet him ſo pittifully abuſed?</p>
                     <p>5. But to be briefe; you may conſider God as your creatour, and you his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo conuerſe with him, as the Holy Ghoſt shall inſpire; or as your King, and you his ſubiect; as your Lord, and you his ſeruant; or as your Father, and you his child; or as your beloued, and you his ſpouſe; or as a frend, and you his familiar; or as a phiſitian: and you his patient; this is a briefe of the wayes to obſerue the preſence of God, Now what the duty of a creature to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, of a ſubiect to his King, or of a ſeruant, to his Lord, of a child, to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of a ſpouſe, to her beloued, or of a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34971:184"/>
frend to his familiar; and of a patient, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his phiſitian; needes no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, for very few are ignorant of it; and dayly experience, doth teach it. Obſerue, that what way ſoeuer, you conceiue, or conſider him, his goodneſſe and loue to vs, is ſuch; that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to our condition, ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or ſagacity; that his high maieſty, may not confound vs; nor his frendly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, breede in vs any diſreſpect, or irreuerence towards him; vntill at length he bring vs, to be of his; and by a true transformation of loue, become one and the ſame with his diuine Maieſty, if the fault be not ours.</p>
                     <p>6. Note that according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of euery one, they may obſerue what ſort of the preſence of God they find moſt profitable; for ſome may profit more by the intellectuall, others by the imaginary; yet, though that be more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this, notwithſtanding is commonly to be more vſed, and is more profitable, by reaſon it is more agreable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more forcible to moue vs, in difficultyes, to ouercome our ſelues; for we beholding his torments and paines, and knowing that he endured, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, for loue of vs, and to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34971:185"/>
for our ſinns; and that we, and not he, deſerued them; will cauſe vs to lament, and grieue for our offences; cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue with humble ſubmiſſion, pardon, for them; doe pennance, ſubdue the paſſions, mortify the body, correct our ſenſes, and liue a vertuous life; and be more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and deſirous to ſerue and pleaſe his diuine Maieſty, then if we conſidered him only omnipotent, immenſe, iuſt and ſo of the reſt, which is not ſo deepe in our intereſt, as the other; but whether you profit by one, or the other; what you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke choyſe of, keepe it all day long, in your mynd, as neere as you can, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one of the wayes formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſo that whereſoeuer you be, he may be a wittneſſe preſent, of all your thoughts, words and deedes<hi>:</hi> it is vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, what profit may hence ariſe to a carefull ſoul.</p>
                     <p>7. There is an other preſence of God ſupernaturall, which his diuine Maieſty, is wont to afford to pure ſoules, without any labour or indruſtry of their part; this bringeth a certaine Maieſty with it, yet nothing ſeene, but by an inward light, and feeling, with one ſimple looke, the ſoul is moued very forcibly, and ſweetly, to acknowledg him then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34971:185"/>
and this leaueth in the ſoul an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable reſpect, and reuerence towards him: of this I shall ſpeake more in the third part God willing.</p>
                     <p>8. To conclude; by reaſon of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition, and inclination, to thinke of the things, of the world and our owne intereſt; being not as yet ſo well mortified, practiſed, and able to keepe a continuall and conſtant preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God: we muſt acknowledg heerin our frailty and weakneſſe, and endeauour carefully, to acquire it, by all meanes, poſſible; it will therefore auaile, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe very much, firſt, to practiſe it dayly, then to haue ſome motiues to bring it to our memory; as when the clock ſtrick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly call to mynd, your preſence of God, and by ſome inward act, addreſſe your ſelfe to him; doe the ſame, when the cock doth crowe, or any bell doth ring. In the houſe likewiſe wherin you dwell, it will be good, for the ſame purpoſe, to giue a denomination to the roomes of the houſe, of the paſſages of our Sauiours life, and death: (as to one, the place of his natiuity; calling it the ſtable where he was borne and laid betwixt an ox and an aſſe to an other, where he made his laſt ſupper with his diſciples, washed

                     <p>9, Alſo it will helpe, to haue ſome few ſtones of beades (which we doe vſe, and call the preſence of God of it) to hang where you, moſt vſually put your hands, that when you touch them, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your preſence of God; you may likewiſe were a ring on your finger, with ſome notable marke, to that ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;

or a ſtring vppon the wreſt of your hand, and ſuch other wayes, of this kind, which may keepe you myndfull in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and tymes, of your preſence of God; for they are moſt admirable and excellent wayes. inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, and practiſed by his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to keepe them myndfull of God alone; and forgetfull of all whatſoeuer elſe: for in this degree, they aſpire to thoſe things which are celeſtiall and eternall; therefore it is requiſit to procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thus, the familiarity and frendship of this great God of glory, who alone can grant what we pretend: for hence we put great confidence in him; for a true and louing frend, as he is, being able, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deny, what according to reaſon is asked by him, whom he doth loue; this preſence of God (as is ſaid) is worthily the fundation, of all vertuous buildings, it is a treaſure beyond treaſures, a good beyond our vnderſtanding, and without which, there is no vnion with God, nor any felicity in this, or the life to come. O moſt ſweet and amiable Ieſu grant vs, to haue thee allwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and mynd nothing but thy ſweet ſelfe alone, and that we may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transformed, and abſorpt in thee.

                     <p>19. Heere deere Chriſtian ſoul, you ſee, how ſweetly the preſence of God, and the vſe, or practiſe of vertue, doe walke, and goe together; and how one helpeth the other, to be continued; for his preſence giueth cauſe of ſpeech; and, familiarity, moueth, and ſweetly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſoul, to thoſe acts, by which, she doth expreſſe her mynd, and deſyre, to imitat and gaine what vertues, she doth perceaue, are gratefull to him, and in him doe appeere moſt perfectly; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, and familiar practiſe, of theſe vertuous acts, keepeth him preſent in her mynd, to whom she doth addreſſe her words.</p>
                     <p>20. But what vnderſtanding is able to conceiue, or tongue to expreſſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feelings, the heart's content, and comforts; which in this conference, the ſoul doth receiue from his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty? truly none, but that really humble

Why may not we then ſpend ſome yeares vſing all care, and diligence, to vſe and practiſe the acts of this celeſtiall trade, by which we may gaine ſuch ſtore of riches, and ſpirituall treaſure, that without difficulty, we may
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34971:191"/>
purchaſe an inheritance in the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of glory, where we may liue plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, deliciouſly and ioyfully for euer?</p>
                     <p>22. Alſo, they may conſider, that we can ſpend whole dayes and nights in the company, and conuerſation of thoſe whom we affect, and loue, or doe expect benefit and profit by; why not then, with our good Ieſus, our deere and louing Lord, and redeemer, who deſyres nothing more, then to be with vs? we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre his company and conuerſation, if we doe loue him, or deſire our owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit, and heauenly riches; for he ſtandeth not in neede of vs, or our company, or conuerſation; but we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand in neede euery moment of him; for of him we depend in all that we are, doe, and haue; and therefore, if not for loue of him, at leaſt for our owne good, and profit; we should heartely affect his company, and deſyre and procure his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity and loue.</p>
                     <p>23. Moreouer is it not an admirable thing, to ſee, how ſeruants for litle wages doe labour night and day, in cold, froſt, and ſnow, and in the greateſt ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; to doe the will, or command of their Lord, maſter, or miſtriſſe: and to giue them content, they often faſt and watch
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34971:192"/>
long, yet they doe all things willingly; and many tymes, they doe ſuffer very much to their owne preiudice, and yet eſteeme it nothing, ſo they know, that it will pleaſe their Lord, or Maſter, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get their good will, and be contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſeruice, for ſo ſmall a reward. Yet our good God, our deere Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, requires no ſuch great toyle and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of vs, but eaſy and ſmall things; as to doe, what he commands in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the decalogy; to keepe a pure conſcience and ſay a few prayers, which is generally for all; but from others of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> higher calling, he requires likewiſe, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſenſes, paſſions, and appetites; and a care to wait vppon him, and keepe him company; for which ſeruice, he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe vs, (and will certainly performe it,) indeficent riches, glory, and life euerlaſting, in his owne Pallace, among his deereſt frends, and to be fed from his owne table for euer. and truly in this very life he doth reward thoſe ſeruants abundantly, with vnſpeakable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and comforts, as is formerly ſaid.</p>
                     <p>24. Are not we then to be thought ſenſleſſe, if we doe not accept of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, being ſo much to our comfort, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34971:192"/>
profit? are not we to be blamed, if we doe not ſpend tyme dayly in the practiſe of thoſe vertuous acts, by which we may gaine the vertues, and purchaſe endleſſe riches in glory? are not we to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnworthy of his fauour, familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gifts, whoſe company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation we value not, nor deſire, though he, euen for our good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, deſyres ours. I doe leaue this, to the conſideration, and cenſure of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man;</p>
                     <p>25. It is no ſmall happineſſe, that we can haue acceſſe, when we pleaſe, to our Lord God, and to make our wants and neceſſityes, and troubles of mynd, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto him; which no prince on earth alloweth to his ſubiects, nor greateſt uaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls; let vs then heartely deſyre, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his holy company, and ſpend our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me with him; to giue him that content, who ſo much deſyres it, for our good. Let vs alſo, to giue him more content, keepe great purity of conſcience which doth highly pleaſe him, and will comfort vs. and obſerue well, whether you labour to amend, what once in your ſelfe, you did reprehend; and whether you goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or backward, dayly in your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and practiſe of vertue; for by it,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34971:193"/>
you gaine true humility;</p>
                     <p>26. And note for your better help, that which followeth. to wit; if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any good in your ſelfe either of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or grace; inſtantly ſay to your ſelfe the words of S. Paul, what ha'ſt thou, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note> which thou ha'ſt not receiued, to wit, from God? if then thou ha'ſt receiued it from him, wherein wilt thou glory? as if he ſaid; whereof can'ſt thou boaſt hauing nothing of thy owne; but what thou ha'ſt is from God; thou art then to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him the praiſe and honour of it, with thankes; and acknowledg all to be due to him alone, and nothing to you. thus you humble your ſelfe, and keepe your ſelfe from pride, and vaine glory.</p>
                     <p>27. Alſo if you perceaue any thing, that is laudable, or good in an other; you muſt not enuy his happineſſe; but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly praiſe God, whoſe gift it is; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe truly, that you are vnworthy of any ſuch;</p>
                     <p>28. Moreouer, if you obſerue any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or imperfection in an other; you muſt not therefore think amiſſe, or condemne him, in your mynd; but endeauour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, and with compaſſion and feare, ſay; his intention is good; but if it be ſuch, that it cannot be excuſed; ſuddenly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34971:193"/>
looke into your heart, and call to mynd, the great ſinns, which in your life paſt, you committed, fearing leaſt you alſo should be tempted; and ſay to your ſelfe; you can take notice of that in him, which is but ſmall, and perhaps before God is nothing, yea good; and cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe many great ſinns, which you committed againſt God, and grieuouſly offended his diuine Maieſty, and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re iuſtly deſerued hell fire; and euen, now, at this preſent, if his holy grace, had not contayned and preuented thee, thou had'ſt done worſſe then he; ſweet Ieſu preſerue all from offending thee.</p>
                     <p>29. Thus humility worketh, and by this practiſe, you shall thinke euery one, better then your ſelfe, and come to be familiar, and inward with your Lord, and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus; whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny if you forſake not, he will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake yours; for the garden of your ſoul is now beautified with this, and other flowers, ſprouting, and shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and begining to breath forth their ſweet odours, that he being Lord of it, can hardly abſent himſelfe from thence, he is ſo taken, and delighted with the pleaſantneſſe, fairneſſe, and Odoriferous ſmells therof. and ſurely he will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                     <p>1. IN the former chapter, you had an example of the practiſe of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the preſence of God, (it being the firſt ſtone, to be ſet in this ſpirituall building, after the preſence of God; which two, as lime and ſtone, maketh a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34971:194"/>
ſolid fundation, for the edifice of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perfection; and without which, your ſpirituall building cannot ſubſiſt:) Now I will doe the ſame with reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conformity to the will of God in all things, for this with facility brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the building to a great height of perfection.</p>
                     <p>2. For ſelfe loue, and the diſordered affection, and eſteeme which we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of our ſelues, for want of the true knowledg of our miſerable condition; is the cauſe of all our miſchiefe: therefore this ould houſe of ſelfe loue, and proper eſteeme, muſt be pulled downe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, before we can begin to build the new, of the loue of God, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perfection;</p>
                     <p>3. There is nothing, more efficacious to caſt it downe, and bring it to ruine, then humility, for as S. Bernard ſaith, ſpeaking of humility; it is a vertue by which with true knowledg of our ſelues, to wit, of our owne miſery and nothing, we ſeeme truly vile and baſe euen to our ſelues; and doe verily belieue it to be ſo; and that all others ought in truth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame of vs, being a meere truth indeede; which knowledg of ſo great baſenes in our ſelues, taketh a way the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34971:195"/>
occaſion of pride, and louing, or eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any thing indiſcreetly of our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues; whereas we plainly ſee, nothing in vs, loue worthy, or to be eſteemed, by any; but rather what deſerueth an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and auerſion from our ſelues, and others; and which is worſſe, that we are ſo before God, and his holy Angells, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we are, wicked and contemptible ſinners; which in their ſight, maketh vs more abominable, then the moſt ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king carion, in the ſight of any prince, who paſſing by, cannot but turne his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce a ſyde, and shut his noſtrills, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the feeling of the foul ayer, which thence doth proceede. for as is ſaid in the firſt part, we are really, but a ſinke full of foul and noyſome ſtuff, and he who looketh inwardly on him ſelfe, will experience this truth. ſo that by this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and knowledg, ſelfe loue falls to the grownd, proper eſteeme, is quite extinct, and the fundation of true perfection ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>4. This fundation being ſo layd; it reſts, that you know, how to bring this building forward, and to your intended end; the moſt compendious, and briefe way that I can find, is; by conformity, or reſignation of our will; in all things, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34971:195"/>
the will of God; our Holy Mother S. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa ſayth, that by this vertue, we giue vnto God, the tree, and the fruit; the tree, of our owne will, which is the ſeat of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue; the fruit; this loue, and all our other affections; ſo that we ſtrip our ſelues, wholy of all proper intereſt, and are no more our's, but his; and by him to be diſpoſed of, as his owne; for he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all, reſerues nothing; he that guieth tree and fruit, giueth all, for nothing more remaines; and conſequently, ſelfe loue, and proper intereſt, with all their edifices, falls to ruine, and then, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the loue of God, may be there ſet vpp, and fairly built; ſelfe loue; doth build Babilon, the citty of Sathan, the place of confuſion, and deſtroyeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Ieruſalem, which is the citty of God, the place of peace; this is the ſoul in ſtate of grace;</p>
                     <p>5. For what can deſtroy a vertuous ſoul, more then pride, vaine glory, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, enuy, which proceede from ſelfe loue; if I had not loued my ſelfe too much, and my owne proper intereſt, I should not be proud, ſet others at naught, boaſt of my owne talents, and doings, or enuy an others proſperity, or care for his preferment before my ſelfe,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34971:196"/>
to any dignity, honour, office, wealth or other benefit; and conſequently, not build an habitation in my ſoul for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who is allwayes where pride and enuy is; for which, he was caſt from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to hell. But by reſignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, being truly obſerued, we giue our will, and all that proceede from it, to God, to be diſpoſed of as his owne, and as pleaſe him; ſo that we muſt doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but according to his will, to whom we haue willingly guien all power ouer vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reſignation;</p>
                     <p>6. But you may ſay; how shall I all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes know his will, that I may perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and doe it? he has declared it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by theſe words; loue God, aboue <note place="margin">

By this you ſee how to doe his will; to wit, that your whole heart, ſoul, powers, and ſenſes, be only employed in his ſeruice, and thoſe things, which are to his honour, and glory, through true loue: and to preuent all emulation, and enuy; he ſaid, and thy
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34971:196"/>
neighbour, as thy ſelfe; which if you doe; Babilon is vtterly brought to ruine, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe loue deſtroyed, the citty of God, by loue of him, and our neighbour, fairly built; and the ſoul ſetled with ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, that nothing can diſturb her inward peace; for she care's not what may happen to her, by reaſon she is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be diſpoſed of in ſickneſſe and health, proſperity and aduerſity, deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſolation, all a like as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty shall be pleaſed; for her will is prompt and ready, to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his in all things; and to deſyre nothing, but what he is pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of her.</p>
                     <p>7. But to come to, and acquire this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertue of reſignation, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you muſt doe, as is formerly declared of humility: As when in your morning prayer, you haue conſidered our Sauiour ſweating in the garden of Gethſemany (which is your preſence of God, that day) nature apprehending and loathing the cruell torments, which he was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, being then repreſented to him; yet not withſtanding, he ſayd, to his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; Father not my will be done, but thyne; as if he ſaid; Father, though the torments, be very cruell, and great,

O my deere Lord, and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu. who in all things, and in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wert reſigned, and conformable to the Holy will, of thy heauenly Father, I doe intend to follow, and imitat thee in this; and euer heerafter, to be reſigned, and conformable to thy holy will in all things, and vppon all occaſions, though neuer ſo contrary to my nature and will.</p>
                     <p>9. O moſt amiable Ieſu, the end, for which I am created, is, to ſerue thee in this world, and to enioy thee in glory, in the other; how can I ſerue thee, vnleſſe I doe thy will? or how shall I haue the

                     <p>10. O my ſweet Ieſu, by thy holy law, which is thy will, I wil regulat all my thoughts, words, and deedes, heerafter; leaſt I should doe any thing contrary to thy expectation, or diſpleaſe thy diuine Maieſty in the ſmalleſt matter.</p>
                     <p>11. O my good God, euen according to naturall reaſon, and for my owne good, and benefit; I ought to preferre thy holy will, before myne, for I know certainly, that thou ha'ſt created me, for thy ſelfe, and to be with thee in glory, and do'ſt deſyre my ſaluation, more then I doe my ſelfe, and do'ſt loue me more then <hi>I</hi> my ſelfe; if thy loue were not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to me, then my owne, I had long ſince, beene in hell; for I knew I should be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in hell, and depriued of endleſſe glory, by ſinne; yet not louing my owne
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34971:198"/>
good and to doe my owne will, contrary to thy command; I freely and often ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, forſaking all right, to grace, and glory, and gaue my ſelfe, vnder the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the deuil, who night and day doth deſyre, and ſeeke my deſtruction, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine; but thou deſiring my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through loue; (which I did not) did'ſt, with thy owne diſcommodity, and great paine, by thy Bitter Paſſion, and lamentable death, free me from all my miſeryes, and the power, and ſlauery of Sathan, making ſatisfaction, to thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, for my ſinns, and all thoſe griueous torments, and punnishments which I deſerued, and had for euer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if thy loue had not thus preuented all; ſo that what I was deſtroying in my ſelfe, thou wert repairing; and what I was condemning, thou wert ſauing; all which, in reaſon, o true louer of my ſoul, giueth me plainly to vnderſtand, that thy loue to me, and care of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is farre more, and greater, then my owne; wherefore I will euer heerafter, reſigne my ſelfe to thee; and leaue my ſelfe wholy to be diſpoſed of, according to thy holy will;</p>
                     <p>12. Moreouer, my deere and louing Ieſu, ſince thy deſyre (as thy Apoſtle
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34971:198"/>
doth affirme) is, that all may be ſaued, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> and none to perish, or be damned; thou wilt according to thy mercy, wiſdome, and prouidence, giue vnto euery one, ſuch neceſſary meanes, and helps, with which, they cooperating may be ſaued; powerfully and ſweetly diſpoſing all things, to that end; therfore my God, what shall pleaſe thee to ſend, shall be welcome vnto me, as moſt conuenient for my ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>13. O my Gracious Lord, my hearts content, and ioy, ſince thy care is ſuch, and thy loue, ſo great to me, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly I find my ſelfe, to be more thyne, then myne, by creation redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſeruation, and many other tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les; It is fitting, thou should'ſt diſpoſe of thy owne according to thy will and pleaſure: I doe therefore reſigne my ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and will haue no other will, but thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, to be done of me.</p>
                     <p>14. Alſo my only good, deere Ieſu, ſince thou knoweſt beſt what is ſitting, and neceſſary for euery one, to come to glory; and wilt ſend the occaſions to each one, by, which, they may deſerue it; hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter in all occaſions, and occurrents, I will ſuppoſe, and ſay; by this, my God will haue me ſaue my ſoul, and come to

                     <p>16. I am thyne, not myne, diſpoſe of me, my God, as shall be moſt to thy glory, and my good; it is fitting, my deere Lord, thou should'ſt doe with thy owne, what, and as beſt pleaſeth thee.</p>
                     <p>17. I cannot o Lord, diſpoſe of my ſelfe, contrary to thy will, being truly thyne, without doing thee a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable iniury; farre be this from me, my God.</p>
                     <p>18. O my deere Sauiour, in all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, I will ſay, with thy Holy Prophet, my heart o Lord is prepared, my heart is prepared, I will ſing and ſay a pſalme; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſ.</hi> 56. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> that is, my heart o God is prepared to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and dy according to thy will; and to ſuffer what aduerſityes shall fall on me, with reſignation to thy will; I will ſing with ioy, and not repine, I will ſay vnto

thee, a pſalme of praiſe, and thanks, for all.</p>
                     <p>19. O my God, what can be ill to me, that cometh through loue from thee; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me then what may; thy will be done of me.</p>
                     <p>20. If thy ſeruant Iob accepted with thankes, the bad, as well as the good, to conforme his will, to thine; much more o Ieſu I ought to be indifferent, and to accept as well of croſſes, and loſſes, as of comforts, and proſperity; and will heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>21. O Lord, I doe often deſyre, what may be my deſtruction, not knowing what is moſt conuenient for my good, I will therefore heerafter, leaue my ſelfe to thy diſpoſing, and content my ſelfe, with what shall happen; as coming from thee becauſe thou know'ſt that, to be beſt for me.</p>
                     <p>22. O deere Ieſu, what iniuryes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, and abuſes didſt thou not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, with content; to conforme thy will, to the will of thy heauenly Father? why then, should not I, my God, in this imitat thee?</p>
                     <p>23. O Sweet Ieſu, the Scripture ſaith, that to doe the will of thy Father, ſtood <note place="margin">

                     <p>24. O Lord, in all tribulations, and croſſes, I will conforme my will, to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, for I doe know, that thou do'ſt giue the greateſt glory, to thoſe, that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, and conformity doe endure the greateſt troubles.</p>
                     <p>25. O Sweet Ieſu, all croſſes, shall be to me moſt gratefull: for I eſteeme them true tokens, of thy loue; for thou do'ſt moſt chaſtice, whom thou do'ſt moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, for their greater merit and glory;</p>
                     <p>26. O moſt louing Ieſu, I doe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that to doe thy will, in this life, and conforme our's, to thyne, in all things is the higheſt, greateſt, and moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruice, that can be done to thee on earth, grant me this o Lord.</p>
                     <p>27. O Ieſu, true comfort of my ſoul, by reſignation to thee, in tribulations, and aduerſityes, the fidelity, and loue, of thy true ſeruants, is moſt knowen; I will neuer therefore eſteeme my ſelfe to loue thee, without this holy vertue;</p>
                     <p>28. O true louer of all vertuous ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, my Ieſu; who in all thy life and death,

wert reſigned to the will of thy heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father for my inſtruction; now in the preſence of thy holy Angells, I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my will, my proper iudgment, and my ſelfe, reſigning all that I am, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, to be wholy, and ſoly, thyne; and diſpoſed of, as thou wilt; for being reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and conformable to thy will, in all things; nothing can diſturbe me; I shall in all occaſions, be quiet in mynd, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, in aduerſity, thankfull, in proſpeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contented, in diſtreſſe, and pouerty, ioyfull, in temptations; faithfull, in all probations, and conſtant without feare, eſteeming all as gaine, for loue of thee Grant me o deere Ieſu, this bleſſing, this gift, this bleſſed and (to thee) moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vertue; that in all what ſoeuer, I may be reſigned, and conformable, to thy holy will.</p>
                     <p>29. I haue heere, deere ſoul, layd befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thee, an example, in theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; the one belonging properly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, the other, to the proficient, that you may know, how to vſe the practiſe of other vertues, with the dayly preſence of God, according to this forme; for thus the knowledg, and habits, of vertues, are acquired; ſoules become familiar, and in fauour with God; mortified, in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

and ſenſes; ſtayd, in their actions, modeſt and compoſed, in their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, moderat, in their ſpeeches; ſweet and affable, in their conuerſation; and circomſpect, in all their proceedings. and thus the garden of the ſoul, is well ordered, the flowers brought to ſprout, and shew themſelues; and when the heat of the ſunne of iuſtice, or the loue of God shining vppon them, doth penetrat the earth, they open, and giue forth ſome breathings, of their ſweet odours, euen before they come to perfection.</p>

                     <head type="sub">How, in ſeuerall wayes, to vſe the preſence of God in Prayer.</head>
                     <p>1. IT is formerly declared what the preſence of God is; and how to keepe it in mynd dayly, intellectually, or imaginatily, and apply it to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of vertue. But in this, you shall know, how after diuers manners, to vſe, and practiſe it, in mentall or vocall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and chiefly in mentall prayer, which in this ſtate, is moſt vſed;</p>
                     <p>2. Firſt then, you muſt vnderſtand,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34971:202"/>
that God is in his creatures many wayes, by his power, preſence, and eſſence; by his power, preſeruing them in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he gaue them; by his preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as Lord of all, and wittneſſe of what they doe inwardly, or outwardly; whoſe knowledg euen of their moſt ſecret thoughts none can shun; by his eſſence, concurring, and cooperating with them in all their actions; ſo that without his concurring they cannot haue the leaſt motion; after theſe manners, he is, as well in ſinners, as in the iuſt; but he is in the iuſt, by an other ſpeciall way, to wit, by grace, ſanctiſijng and adopting them, to be the children of God;</p>
                     <p>3. Moreouer, in ſome iuſt, he is in a more eminent manner, then in others; as in thoſe who follow a retyred, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, by ſome ſpeciall fauour, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward illuminations and conſolations, in others, by certaine influences of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, clearing the vnderſtanding, in the knowledg of truthes, and inflaming the will, with the loue of God, and thoſe things, which are eternall; alſo, he is in vs, in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, when we communicat; for ſaid he, behold I am with you to the world's end, to him heere, we may haue an eaſy

                     <p>4. O what a comfort, this is to all Chriſtians? to know certainly, that they haue within them, ſo happy a gueſt and lodger, (if the fault be not in them) God omnipotent, their creatour, Lord, and Sauiour, for as the ſoul giueth life, and operations to the body, God giueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life and operations to the ſoul; and there maketh his kingdome, ſeat, and throne, if ſinne doth not hinder it, ought not we then haue in our heartes, in all places, and at all tymes, a great reſpect and reuerence, to this our Soueraigne Lord, and King, whom we certainly know to be preſent? o how dare we doe in his preſence, what we would blush to doe, before a meane man? o what can be

                     <p>6. Some there are, that in prayer doe begin to think vppon God in a generall manner, and in a confuſed way, not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to any particular, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider many good things, not fixing ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly vppon any one; but going from one to an other calling to mynd the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Scripture of the Holy Fathers, and adorning all, with many learned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34971:203"/>
but all this remaynes only, in the vnderſtanding, and they take content; and pleaſure them ſelues, in thoſe fine diſcourſes, and conceits, more then in any pious affection; ſo that in this, there is ſome want of humility, though not of vaine glory; for the vnderſtanding, fed, with theſe ſentences, and reaſons, taketh a complacence in them, and conceaueth well of that diſcourſe, that it is learnedly done, and attendeth to the curioſity of it, and not to moue the will, to any pious worke, to pleaſe and loue God; and this is the greateſt cauſe why many doe not profit in prayer, and vertue, after the vſe of prayer, for twently yeares, more then in the firſt yeare; by reaſon all is in the vnderſtanding, and they content them ſelues with diſcourſe, and ſeldome fall to imitation, mortification, good purpoſes, and reſolutions, to gaine this, or that vertue; or ouer come this or that vice;</p>
                     <p>7. But howſoeuer, to ſpend tyme in thinking vppon good things, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the mynd from vaine, and idle thoughts, is meritorious, and beneficiall; for their intention going to prayer, was good, and for God, Our Holy Mother S. Tereſa ſayth, that though learning be very good, and helpeth, and comforteth
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34971:204"/>
much, before, and after prayer, yet being there, before the eternall and infinit wiſdome of God, it muſt be for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſet a ſyde; for humility, and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, there, is of more force, and value, then many ſpeculatiue, and learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; Therefore she aduiſeth that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prayer, and placeing your ſelfe in God's diuine preſence, without wearijng the vnderſtanding, with long diſcourſes, ſearching heere, and there; this, and that, or vſing any framed, or compoſed ſpeaches, or reaſons, ſimply, and humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, propoſe your neceſſityes, to his diuine Maieſty, acknowledging his goodneſſe, mercy, and benefits done to you, and that euen then, he doth ſo graciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, to his preſence, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his high maieſty, and greatneſſe; and your vile condition, and baſeneſſe; and calling to mynd, that, what he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was for you, (if your meditation was of the paſſion) and meerly of loue, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any merit, or deſert, on your behal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe; and then, with all ſubmiſſion, deſyre him for that loue, and what he ſuffered, to grant your requeſt, and giue you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, not to offend him more, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne loue, for loue, doing what ſeruice you thinke, to be gratefull to him, this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34971:204"/>
is a compendious, and good way of prayer.</p>
                     <p>8. Note, that as I ſaid before, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in prayer you humble your ſelfe, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging your owne vnworthyneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ignorance, and inſufficiency, and all good, and the honour, glory, and praiſe of all, to be due to God alone, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, euen thoſe good thoughts, which then you haue, to be from him, as truly they are) the more is your gaine, and ſpirituall profit; and the better, and more efficacious your prayer.</p>
                     <p>9. For this good himility hath, that it maketh one gratefull to all, but much more to God, who giueth his grace, and other fauours plentifully to the humble ſoules, which he doth deny, to thoſe that doe preſume of their owne witt, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, by reaſon of their learning, and ability, in diſcourſing well, in prayer. But whether this meditation be of the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or diuinity, as of Gods attributes and perfections, to witt, his power, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wiſdome, goodneſſe, &amp;c. (which in deede well conſidered doe delight, and feede the vnderſtanding very much) all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, deſcend to ſome one point, and thence conſider, what it auayleth you; and inferre, that you ought to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34971:205"/>
loue, ſerue, and praiſe God, who is ſo good, and bountifull vnto you; and then make good purpoſes to doe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what acceptable to his diuine Maieſty; as ſome pennance, to ſerue him, with more diligence, and care, then formerly; to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe a purer conſcience from any ſinne, that may diſpleaſe him; to amend ſome vice, or imperfection, or exerciſe your ſelfe, more exactly, in ſome vertue; for want of ſoe doing moſt that vſe prayer doe come to litle mortification, of their paſſions; leſſe profit in vertue, and no great feeling of the loue of God, and true perfection.</p>
                     <p>10. Many doe vſe, in prayer to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelues compaſſed, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, and that they are in God, which is a very truth, and it is a good way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and nothing troubleſome though more ſubiect to diſtractions, then that of the humanity, by reaſon we behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the humanity, or any point of it we haue ſomewhat within the reach, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our ſenſes, that we may apply our vnderſtanding to, and employ it, with reſt: but in the other, being beyond our reach, the vnderſtanding is like to one ſwiming in the middle of a great ſea, not ſeing land, nor knowing well whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34971:205"/>
to goe, or to what ſide to turne, but ſwimeth heere and there in hope of ſome reſting place; or as our Holy Mother ſaith, the vnderſtanding conſidering the diuinity, is like vnto a bird flijng heere and there, and can find no reſting place; ſo that the vnderſtanding is (as we may ſay) a ſtray, and its thoughts, many, and vnſetled;</p>
                     <p>11. Alſo in this manner ſome doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to aſcend ſo high with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that they labour to ſuſpend it, from working, ſo to remaine in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, keeping themſelues paſſiuly, that God may worke in them; which our Holy Mother doth not approue, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it hath ſome want of humility, for they preſume to reach higher, then God is pleaſed to carry them; and the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being forced beyond his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, leaueth the will in aridity, without any benefit; for the will followeth with its affection, the knowledg of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</p>
                     <p>12. Therefore in the name of God, let the vnderſtanding worke with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; vntill his diuine Maieſty vouchſafeth to eleuat it, and ſet it, at reſt, in true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; for, when he is pleaſed ſo to doe, he preſenteth the obiect, and that,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34971:206"/>
which without force, or violence, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpendeth the vnderſtanding, and keepeth it employed; as long as he ſeeth it good; and noe longer, it can remaine ſo;</p>
                     <p>13. As for the imaginary preſence of God, you may conceaue him preſent, without you; before you, or at your ſyde, you looking on him, and he on you; and in that manner make your prayer, by a humble diſcourſe or conſideration of ſome part of his life, or paſſion, for as is ſaid, your beholding him, ſuffering for loue of you, to make ſatisfaction, for your ſinns, will be a motiue, to ſtirre you to a tenderneſſe of heart, to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion vppon him, in that caſe; to grieue for your ſinns, which were the cauſe of his ſuffering; and to doe ſome pennance, in ſatisfaction of them; with many other good effects, and reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>14. But obſerue, that ſome doe in a repide manner, conſider the paſſion of our Sauiour, not as a thing preſent, but paſt long ſince; neyther doe they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dignity, that ſuffereth, but in a generall manner that he ſuffered for them, and for all men; they aske him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuneſſe for their ſinnes; and ſoe end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they ought to conſider carefully his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34971:206"/>
the greatneſſe of his paine, with what loue, and for whom, he ſuffered all; for in this manner, it will be more mouing, and profitable;</p>
                     <p>15. Others are of a more liuly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and doe conceiue our Sauiour, as then ſufferring, and the Iewes then acting their cruelty againſt him; they ſeeme to ſee his flesh there torne, the blood runing freshly downe ouer all his ſacred body, they conſider his loue, and the greatneſſe of his paine; and that their ſinnes were cauſe of all; they are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently moued, theyr heart with griefe is ready to burſt, they ſigh, and ſob heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the teares runne in great abundance from their eyes, loue doth melt them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; they doe not apprehend, nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re any auſterity; their reſolutions to doe ſomewhat to pleaſe God, are many, and great; they are neuer ſatisfied with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, pennances, and punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt them ſelues; and if they be not hindered, and moderated, by their directour, with vndiſcreat zeale, they ouer loade the poore body, and ſoone bring them ſelues to ſickneſſe; this is much to be eſteemed; though it may proceede from the deuil; for theſe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are for the moſt part in the ſenſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34971:207"/>
or inferiour part, of man; and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be vſed, in all their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; they muſt not force them ſelues in prayer, to more teares, or to more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but follow the inſtructions, layd downe in the third chapter of this part, let them not make too much haſt, they muſt doe things, by degrees, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward auſterityes, muſt not be great, and chiefly, ſuch as may hinder their health; but the mortification, of their ſenſes, and paſſions, rigourous;</p>
                     <p>16. Others can doe none of all theſe, and they ouerlabour and tyre the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, endeauouring to frame ſome repreſentation of our Sauiours diuinity, or humanyty, yet can doe but litle, or nothing; at leaſt to continew, for any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; but howſoeuer, they diſcourſe, and ſpeake to him, (the light of faith only guiding, and inſtructing them, that he is there, and doth heare and vnderſtand them, as truly he doth,) and though they grieue to ſee their owne litle ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and capacity, yet they doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but goe on, and by the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deuotion, they feele him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; this their labour is of great merit, and to God very acceprable; for it is the worke of a louing, and reſolute ſoul, it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34971:207"/>
being done with ſo great difficulty, and aridity; and our Sauiour doth often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence it, with perfect contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I thinke, that I ſpoake of this in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me other chapter, yet it is of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that it cannot be to often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated;</p>
                     <p>17. Others doe frame the preſence of God, their deſyres are great, and they would faine doe ſomewhat, but they know not what to doe, what to ſay, or what to aske; this commonly is the caſe of beginners; let them read the ſixth and ſeauenth chapters, of this part, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the aduiſes had there, and they may make good reſolutions, and purpoſes, to ſerue, and pleaſe God, and doe ſome ſmall pennances; for theſe may be done without great diſcourſe, or art, and they will giue ſome ſatisfaction, to thoſe ſwelling deſyres, and bring them, to a calme, and ſettlement. theſe are ſaid of the outward preſence of God; and note, that to helpe them ſelues in prayer, it is neceſſary, that they be prompt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in making actes of all vertues, which are gayned by the practiſe, and vſe, of them. for with them, they may paſſe the tyme of prayer, either in their greateſt comforts, or greateſt aridity, and they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34971:208"/>
will inflame the ſoul, with the fire of the loue of God, and penetrat the heart like ſo many darts.</p>
                     <p>18. Now let vs conſider how inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may keepe the preſence of God, in prayer; for though the other; be good; yet this without any compariſon, is farre better, more mouing, and beneficiall; and they who vſe it, doe ſooneſt come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, naturall, and ſupernaturall; we call the other preſence of God, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by reaſon the thing repreſented, is conceaued to be outward, as before you, or at your ſyde in the place, where you pray; but this, is called inward, by reaſon the obiect, or thing repreſented, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be with in your body, in your heart, or the center of the ſoul; as for example, ſuppoſe the eyes of the ſoul, to be reſident in the head, and from thence, to looke vpwards when you conſider God or his ſaints to be in heauen; and to looke downward, when you conſider hell, or Purgatory; and to looke inward, when you conſider God, to be in your heart, or in a more priuat roome further in, as in the center, or moſt intimat part of the ſoul, it is not eaſy to make this to be vnderſtood: but howeuer, I will doe my beſt endeauour with Gods aſſiſtance,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34971:208"/>
to declare it, that it may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;</p>
                     <p>19. The vnderſtanding as is ſaid vſing his operations, is perceiued to worke in the head, as in his owne ſeat, and lookes, as from a height and a farre of, into the heart, or inward of the ſoul, where he doth, ſee God to be, either imaginarily, or intellectually, as our Sauiour's humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſome great light, for the diuinity; and though, betwixt both, there be a great diſtance, yet he doth addreſſe his ſpeech vnto him; and few goe farther in, though they practiſe prayer for many yeares, by reaſon of too many viſitations and frequentations of worldly, and vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thoughts and obiects which keepe them there employed; the cauſe of this, is; litle mortification of the ſenſes, and paſſions;</p>
                     <p>20. But purged ſoules, may goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in, and get downe the ſtayres to the antecamera, or drawing chamber; for they are not buſied nor detayned with worldly imaginations, they bade them adiew, and now all their endeauour is, to pleaſe this their Lord, and to come into the roome, where he is reſident that face to face they may ſpeake, and make their cauſe knowen vnto him, now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34971:209"/>
good leiſure, and opportunity;</p>
                     <p>21. Heere the ſoul begins to worke vnderſtandingly, feelingly, and ſincerly, though as yet she be not come where he is to be ſeene face to face, but he is, as, within a curtine, or at leaſt they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that they ſpeake as being in a good diſtance from him; heere you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue plainly that the vnderſtanding is parted from his owne houſe, that is, the head, and is ſpeaking in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the head not being more mynded, or thought of, and the other ſenſes, doe follow, and all doores are commonly ſo shut, that no ſtranger or worldly thought, can get in thither; heere the ſoul is neerer to the preſence of God; is more recollected then formerly, the vnderſtanding, better ſetled; the knowledg, cleerer, and more perfect; and the will, better, and more ſeriouſly affected; and all the ſenſes, well employed, and contented; in ſo much, that they eaſily forget their outward functions, and operations; for the ioy, which they heere enioy, is greater, then what they could haue, from their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects; and this doth cauſe them, with the other powers, to giue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attendance, though they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their owne; they that are gone
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34971:209"/>
ſo farre in praier, may know this to be ſo; for if they be applyed, and looking on <note place="margin">Heere the eyes of the ſoul are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fixed in a King of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the preſence of God, as is ſaid, though the outward eyes, be open, and a booke placed before them, they know not a word, but they ſee the letters without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice or reflecting vppon them, by reaſon of the inward attention.</p>
                     <p>22. All this is ſaid, to giue ſome way, to vnderſtand, how the ſoul, doth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, bring the powers, and ſenſes, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hin her ſelfe, to helpe her more fully, and quietly to apply her ſelfe to her negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God;</p>
                     <p>23. At laſt, and not without labour, and long practiſe, the ſoul getteth into the ſecret roome, farre within her ſelfe, attended with her powers, and ſenſes, where her beloued ſpouſe is; heere, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is ſo great, that they eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, not only their owne functions; but alſo, all things of the world, heere the ſoul, is in contemplation, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in great admiration, the will ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſtrongly affected, and vnited, by loue; the memory, is at reſt, mynding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that only, which is preſent, in which she is ſetled, the other ſenſes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues their attendance, ſo carefully, and with ſuch content, that they are a frayd

                     <p>24. This perfection of prayer is not ſuddenly gained, but after long exerciſe, and practiſe, of mortification, of our pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, our outward and inward ſenſes with great purity of conſcience; true it is, that by great diligence ſome doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it ſooner, then others, being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and courragious; and when God is pleaſed, he giueth this giſt, to beginners; for I haue knowen thoſe, that in leſſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, then a yeare, did attaine to it; but commonly, it is acquired by degrees, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the inward ioy, inuiting and ſweetly, inducing the powers, and ſenſes,

                     <p>25.

by any induſtry, can he be brought from it; euen ſo, what cuſtome you giue your ſelfe vnto from the begining, in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and keeping, the preſence of God in prayer; the ſame the ſoul will allwayes deſyre, be it good, or bad; therefore it will be requiſit, to begin with a ſetled way, that beginners may not eaſily erre; and to this end, ſoe many manners, and wayes, of the preſence of God, and ſo many parts of mentall prayer, are layd before their eyes, that a certaine and conſtant method may be, by euery one obſerued.</p>
                     <p>27. Note, that though Moyſes in King Pharao's houſe had the fauour of the King, and worldly content; yet he had noe bleſſings of importance from God; vntill he forſooke the Pallace, and went into the deſart, or wilderneſſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by the practiſe of prayer, he became familiar, and inward with God; and at length, his diuine Maieſty, deſirous to free his owne people, from the ſlauish bondage of Pharao in Egipt. appointed Moyſes, to be their captaine, to lead them from Egipt, and the thraldome, of <note place="margin">

In like ſort, though thou ha'ſt the world at will; if thou art deſirous to haue Gods familiarity, and conuerſation, and the bleſſings, fauours, and ſweet content which he is wont to giue to his ſeruants; goe with Moyſes into the deſart or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, (for in Kings Pallaces, the noyſe of cittyes, or multitude of people, this happineſſe is not had) forſaking King Pharao's Pallace, to wit, the world, the trouble ſome Noyſe, of people, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of vaine thoughts, imaginations, diſordered affections, and inclinations, by a ſweet retyrement, of all thy powers, facultyes, and ſenſes, within thy ſelfe, as is ſaid'; for in that ſolitude, thou may'ſt haue, and enioy the preſence, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of thy heauenly ſpouſe, that great God of glory, who can make, thee cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to free his people, to wit, thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, facultyes and ſenſes, from the thraldome of Egipt, this vaine world, and the ſlauish bondage, of Sathan; that on the Altar of thy heart, with ioy, and true content, thou may'ſt offerre due ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of loue, thankes, and praiſe, to

Then, whether you doe vſe to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and in what part commonly of prayer doe you feele it, what doth moſt cauſe it; whether it be of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, or for any long tyme, or no; to all this the former chapter will giue you not a litle helpe.</p>
                     <p>3. Secondly examin, whether your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer be with diſcourſe, or no; if with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34971:213"/>
whether you are eaſily or hardly moued; and what doth moſt moue you; and to what are you moſt moued; whether to compaſſion, compunction, pennance, feare, loue, this or that vertue, or hatred of ſome vice; and whether you be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently moued, or no; if it be without diſcourſe; how doe you employ your ſelfe all the tyme of prayer; whether in reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting idle thoughts, makeing of actes of vertues, or giuing God thankes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good reſolutions, and purpoſes; to this the 4. chapter of this part will help very much.</p>
                     <p>4. Thirdly, whether the vnderſtanding, at any tyme, omitting the noyſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward words, can reſt, ſweetly beholding the obiect, and for how long? whether this, be with content, or no; whether you find a deſyre to continue in prayer, (though you haue litle comfort in it) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pleaſe God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to you, to be kept, or hindered from prayer, at the due tyme; vnleſſe it be, for obedience, or charity? for then we muſt leaue God, as is ſaid, for God, and ſome are glad, to get an occaſion, to be kept from prayer, when they are to goe to it; which is no good ſigne; then whether the manner of your prayer, be with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34971:214"/>
of God inward, or outward? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt of the diuinity, or humanity; whether you ſpend more tyme in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue partes, then in the others; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after prayer, you find your ſoul continue in the preſence of God; or haue a memory of him? and how long doth it continue? and whether (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout procuring it) your ſoul in doing outward things, be myndfull of God, haue ſome pious affections, or is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing acts of vertues, or is ſpeaking with God; and obſerue aboue all other things, whether in prayer, but chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely after it, you find a humble diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a loathſomneſſe in your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to be eſteemed, or well ſpoaken of? for the prayer which is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed, with this vertue of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is to be allwayes ſuſpected, though neuer ſo high; and not to be eſteemed of any great importance; whether you find your ſelfe with a hauineſſe or dullneſſe; or lightneſſe, and ſerenity of ſpirit; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you find your ſoul in loue with God, and whether this loue, be free, and with ſincerity, and not a coacted, or forced loue; and whether the ſoul doth incline to amorous actes, and delight rather in them, then in diſcourſe? then, what ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34971:214"/>
you doe vſe to ſpend in mentall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, morning and euning?</p>
                     <p>5. Fourthly what ſort of prayer, you doe vſe; whether naturall, or ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; that is, acquired by your labour, and practiſe; or infuſed by God; then, whether it be habituall, or tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that is to ſay, whether that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed prayer, is guien you only for that one, or more tymes, which I call tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory; but that which is habituall; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any induſtry or labour on your part, doth as ſoone as you place your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to pray, put you in a ſweet recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, you haue him preſent, with whom you may ſpeake, and matter to ſpeake of adminiſtred, you not knowing how; and this is vſuall whenſoeuer you goe to prayer, if it be infuſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall; and marke, that the preſence of God, which is there, and then giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, bringeth with it, ſo great a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his being preſent; that it procureth with one looke on it, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and reuerentiall reſpect, with great humility in the ſoul; towards God.</p>
                     <p>6. Fiftly, (if you haue any viſions or reuelations,) examin whether they be inward, or outward, imaginary, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34971:215"/>
intellectuall, with words, or no; alſo whether you haue ſweet ſmells, or noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; a delightfull alteration in your body, heare muſike not knowing how, or whence; whether you haue extaſis, or rapts, and what you feele in them; and whether you haue the degrees of prayer, with their effects, which are mentioned in the third third part of this booke, or, any of them. In all this, and what ſoeuer elſe; be carefull, to acquaint your directour, with what paſſeth; be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſilent, and doe nothing without his aduiſe, and approbation; for ſo doing, you shall hardly be deceiued by the deuil, or erre much, in your proceedings; this our Sauiour told to our holy mother S. Tereſa, as she affirmeth. Moreouer by conference of thoſe things, with your directour, you shall learne to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what you doe, well, or ill in prayer; and be the better able to expreſſe your ſelfe, in declaring your mynd, and thoſe ſpirituall thing, vnto him, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure of themſelues, and not eaſily vnder ſtood, or explicated by the very learned, that haue not experience in themſelues of them; much leſſe by others not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</p>
                     <p>7. Laſtly examin, how liuly is your
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34971:215"/>
faith, and what confidence you haue in God, that he will grant, what you deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; this is of great importance; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your loue to God, doe make you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull to shun the leaſt imperfections, and to be imagining, and inuenting wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes to pleaſe him, more and more, day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</p>
                     <p>8. I haue knowen ſome (though in the world, and many occaſions) giuen to prayer, and mortification; and I beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, there be many, that haue made a good progreſſe, in prayer; and haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that, which is ſupernaturall, not knowing of it; nor what they doe: by reaſon, they want a directour, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; and they want knowledg, to examin their manner of prayer, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit; or what they feele; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore they think that they doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in prayer, that is good; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they doe not diſcourſe; though they find a great quietneſſe, inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſatisfaction, not knowing how, or what it is; and often they omit their prayer, thinking their tyme loſt; and ſo they goe backward, and not forward; and the deuil is not wanting, in like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to trouble, and tempt them, and perſwade them, to omit their prayer; as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34971:216"/>
being nothing beneficiall to them, and there, they looſe; where, they ought to gaine.</p>
                     <p>9. For, not to goe forward in God's ſeruice, is to goe backward; and our ſoul in this world, is like vnto aboate, which muſt come to its port, forced againſt a ſtrong current, or a ſwift riuer, by great art, and induſtry, of the boatmen, allwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes one begining to put on, before the other doth end, his action; ſo that there is no intermiſſion, or deſiſting, but a continuall forceing on, vntill they arriue at the intended place; for if all deſiſt from worke, neuer ſo litle; the boate is carryed away, with the violence of the water; in ſo much, that what in a long tyme, with great labour, they gained, of the way; they, as it were, in an inſtant, doe looſe. it is the ſame with thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre to be vertuous, and acquire perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for they are forceing the boate, of their ſoul, on, forward, to it, with great art, and labour, againſt the ſwift, and ſtrong current, of their naturall appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, inclinations, diſordered and vnmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified paſſions: but if they deſiſt, neuer ſo litle, or omit their excerciſe, at any tyme, and their vigilancy ouer themſelues; they are forcibly carryed away backward, to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34971:216"/>
what nature doth deſyre; and what they gained in a long tyme, is ſuddenly loſt, and hardly recouered; Therefore we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue neede of helpers; and helps, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes, to forward vs, againſt ſo ſtrong a current; to which, there is none like; the helpers, are God, your directour, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perſons; the helps, God's grace, deuout bookes, dayly practiſe of vertue, with the preſence of God, mortification, and prayer; with one of theſe, you muſt be in continuall action, and then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the ſweet breathing wynd, of the Holy Ghoſt, with this your labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diligent care, will bring you at length, to the happy, and deſyred port of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>10. And by reaſon your enemyes, the world, the flesh, and the deuil, are witty, ſtrong, and vigilant, and doe giue you many dayly battayles, you muſt alſo examin, how you doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, in occaſions; and what armes, and weapons, they moſt feare; for of this, and your diligent care; your ſafty, and ſecurity, doth depend; ſo that you muſt often conſider, what may be offenſiue, and what defenſiue, how to annoy, and how to preuent; becauſe your life on earth is a continuall warfare. for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34971:217"/>
if at any tyme, you growe tepid, and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> negligent, you ſtand in danger to be ſurpriſed, and loſt, by thoſe cruell traytors, who continually, doe watch, meditate, and intend your vtter rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</p>
                     <p>11. I doe therefore aduiſe, that commonly in prayer, you examin what you doe; whether you goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or backward in God's ſeruice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your thoughts, wordes, and deedes; and euery day, make new purpoſes, to amend this, or that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, though it be neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, or ſmal; and doe ſome particular thing to the honour, and glory of God; in thankes, and token of gratitude, for his bleſſings, and benefits; as to kiſe the earth three tymes, in honour of the Holy Trinity; or fiue tymes, in honour of the fiue wounds, of Chriſt our Sauiour, who for loue of you, was ſo wounded; or to ſtand, or kneele with you handes ſtreched forth, in a croſſe, while you ſay the litanyes of our bleſſed lady of Loretto, or the Pſalme of Miſerere mei Deus, or fiue Paters and Aues, or a creede. and ſuch like ſmall things; for belieue me, theſe will make you myndfull of God,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34971:217"/>
and your ſelfe; and augment his grace, and loue in your ſoul; and encourrage you, to higher matters; and it is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to his diuine Maieſty, very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and you muſt be in continuall warre, with the vice, or paſſion, which doth moſt moleſt you, giuing it, no reſt, nor quatter, as is ſaid before; vntill you ouercome, and ſubdue it, that you may haue the full dominion, ouer it, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe your inward houſe in peace, and all ſubiection, to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Holy lawes; thus you shall knowe, how pure, and cleane your garden is; and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection, your flowers are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; and you shall be the better able, to giue an account of all to your directour, of which, and his good direction, your good, and ſpirituall profit doth much depend.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the vnitiue Way, or ſtate of the perfect.</head>
                     <p>1. DEere Chriſtian ſoul, you haue ſeene, in the two former ſtates, how the garden is digged, purged, ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how the ſeedes are ſowen, and the plantes, ſet, and brought to growth; ſo that, euery flower, may be diſcerned, one from the other; and that the garden is growen pleaſant and delightfull; but in this ſtate, you shall ſee the flowers, with the heat, of the ſunne of iuſtice, open; their beauty perfectly appeere; their variety, rare, and wonderfull faire; all breathing forth their ſweet odour, and fragrancy, without meaſure; which in deede, is ſo delightfull, that it brings the world, to admiration; for heere the light is ſo pure, and the knowledg, ſo great, and perfect; that humility, is moſt profound, contempt of our ſelues, and all that is not God, in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; honours, and proper eſteeme, quite trode vnderfoote; pouerty of ſpirit, in very great requeſt; and charity, as lady,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34971:218"/>
ruling, and directing all, with true reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, abſolute abnegation, in ſincere loue, and conformity to God's diuine will, in all things, without exception; in all which, true perfection doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>2. An example, and a perfect patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, of theſe three ſtates, you shall ſee, in one, and the ſame body; to witt, Bleſſed Mary Magdalen; she few dayes before, walked the ſtreetes, with ſuch pride, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and beauty; that as a beneficiall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to Sathan, she allured to ſinne, the heartes, and affection, of thoſe, that with pure eyes, did not behold her; she was a foul garden plot, wherein all vice was got; but by the preaching of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, she vnderſtanding her wofull ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and lamentable caſe; to purge and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this garden plot, cleane; firſt, she doth caſt of her rich and vaine attyre, them barefooted, meanly clothed, her hayre about her eyes, along the ſtreet she goes, and enters among ſtrangers, where our Sauiour was inuited to a feaſt: and in the view of all, caſting her ſelfe vppon her knees, knocking her breſt, with ſighes, from the bottome of her heart, did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace kiſſe, wash with her teares, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe cleane, with the golden hayre (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                     <p>3. She came thither in ſinne; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſinne, did abound, grace did ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; she came wicked, she returned iuſtified; she came ſick, but returned healthy, well, and ſound; she came alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether troubled, she returned, quiet, and contented; she came vncleane, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified; she returned purified, and compoſed; she came a beginner, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

ſoone a proficient, and by this one reſolute action, by which she ouercame her ſelfe totally; she became truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, vnited with true loue and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, to the Holy will of God; and though she made no noyſe of words, yet her ſilent ſpeech, was heard by him, who knew the ſecrets of all hearts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, thy many ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; I haue heard thy prayer, and granted thy requeſt, goe in peace, and ſinne no more.</p>
                     <p>4. At theſe wordes of life, ſweet was her content, and great her ioy, darkneſſe fled, the light of grace appeering in her happy ſoul; O how powerfull, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue are the wordes of God? (goe liue in peace) o diuine benediction, o hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gift, o admirable treaſure? goe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in peace; this peace, did quiet her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and troubled mynd; ordered, and ſetled her paſſions, and appetites, in due ſubiection; compoſed her ſenſes, and left no place in her, for further warre. or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe; her ioyfull heart, did then melt, with the heat, of the fire of diuine, loue;</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34971:221"/>
vnder ground, she liued a while; but it was in the citty, and tis like, that she had ſome viſitations of frends, and others, which was a hinderance to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre; which was to be buſied with God alone; and therefore she parted thence and went to a vaſt, and high mountaine, neere the towne, where, in a ſolitary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, or hole; she liued in contemplation of the paſſion of our Sauiour, and diuine miſteryes, for the ſpace of thirty three yeares, not taſting any earthly foode, but dayly, by the Angells of heauen, ſeauen tymes, was eleuated, and carryed in the ayer towards the kingdome of glory (which she expected) and was recreated with the ſweet muſick, and ioyfull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of celeſtiall Ieruſalem, quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all that was on earth;</p>
                     <p>7. What more perfect patterne of all degrees of ſpirituall perfection, can be ſeene? she put the axe to the roote, in the very begining, and brought downe the tree of all vice, and imperfections, to the ground, on a ſudden; she had in dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, a ſtrong reſolution, to forſake and ouercome all; her attempt, (to her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne confuſion) was great and ſtout; she ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to a ſpeedy conuerſion, a true reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a perfect abnegation, and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,

For the world, is not the vnſenſible things, only; as the vanityes, honours, wealth, pleaſures, and ſuch like; but alſo the people, corrupt manners, ſelfe loue, proper iudgment, our owne will, our Paſſions, and ſenſes; all theſe doe helpe, and induce to ſinne. this then is the world, to be principally, and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, and ſo acquire the loue of God, and true perfection; when S.

them ſelues, their poſſeſſions, that they may not be in any want, or neede, leaſt to trouble themſelues, to ſeeke for any thing, that might be neceſſary for their accommodation; thinking this, not to be an obſtacle to vertue, but rather a helpe to all perfection; and the deuil doth ſo cunningly ſuggeſt, that it would hinder their deuotion extreamly, to be in want of a houſe, meat, drinke, cloathing; or to be careing for theſe things; alſo that they muſt haue a care of their health, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe themſelues well clod, and shod, in the winter, muſt eat moderatly; yet good and wholſome meates, well dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; muſt ſleepe well, and ſuch like; ſo that, they hauing all accommodation may without trouble ſerue God, vſe their ſpirituall exerciſes, and attaine to the loue of God, and true perfection; and withall our nature deſirous of proper commodity, and thinking that this may ſtand, with true vertue, and perfection, is eaſily perſuaded, to giue beliefe to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all is carryed vnder the colour of pretended helpes, to acquire vertue; and perfection.</p>

                     <p>13.

17. Of theſe likewiſe, there be many Noblemen, and women, and others of great eſtates, that hauing vſed a retired life, much prayer, and mortification of their bodyes, are deſirous to forſake all, and embrace a religious ſtate of life, in ſome holy order; but the deuil is not hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wanting to hinder ſo great a good; and firſt he placeth as a reaſonable thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their face; that they muſt doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rashly, but be aduiſed by their frends, and Ghoſtly Father; and when they haue ſo done; the frends, (chiefly if they haue a benefit by their remaining in their owne eſtate,) doe alleage vnto them, their tenderneſſe, the great rigour and auſterity of a religious life, and what a hard thing it is to be at the will, and command of an other, who may want diſcretion, and other qualityes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a ſuperiour; and haue no regard of them, more then of a poore man's ſonne, who was brought vp to labour, and may cauſe them to doe ſeruile wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which they were not bred to, and hinder them from prayer, and other good workes, which in the world they could haue done, with great perfection; as to build Churches, bridges, high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, maintaine orphans, preferre poore

decayed gentlemens daughters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the poore, and many other good and charitable deedes; which in religion they cannot doe; and then they preſent to them, the example of many Emperours, Kings, and quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that by their good deedes, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, remaining in the world, were great ſaints, as Henry the firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and his wife; Lewis, of France, Edward of England, Helena, Empreſſe, two Elizabethes, of Portugall, and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and diuers others, ſaints; and then the Ghoſtly Father perhaps out of ſome human reſpects, and loath to offend the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe frends, doth conſent and concurre with their remayning in the ſame ſtate, vnder this holy pretence, that they may be vertuous, and ſaints as well, as others, that liued ſo.</p>
                     <p>18. But this was a ſpeciall and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fauour of God, done to them, not commonly granted; and therefore the poore ſoules are deceiued, being thus perſuaded, not to follow gods holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, but are hindred to be free from theſe tyes, with which they are kept faſt, and cannot goe forward, with true freedome, and liberty, to perfection, and the loue of God; for often it falleth out,

that theſe good ſoules hauing the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion preſent, in tyme of temptation, and aridity, not finding thoſe inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and conſolations, which they were wont to haue, may fall from their godly exerciſes, to worldly recreations, rather then ſuffer that trouble, and aridity; and perhaps fall into ſinne, as Dauid, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon did, after receiuing many great graces, and fauours from God; but Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid did pennance; and whether Salomon be ſaued, or damned, it is doubtfull, and moſt ſay; that he is not ſaued; I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one of quality, who was thus deceiued, and fell after acquiring a great progreſſe in prayer<hi>:</hi> whereas, if he had forſaken all, and become religious, the occaſion of falling, had not beene; for in religion in tyme of aridity, they haue an encourragment (by ſeing the example of others) to goe forward; and they would be vnmyndfull of any other thing, and reſolutly, and conſtantly goe on, and doe the will of God, in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; in hope to gaine the comforts, and other feelings, they had formerly of God; alſo they haue not any motiue preſent, to withdraw them from their ſpirituall exerciſes, wherewith to diuert their mynds; for being religious, neceſſity
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34971:232"/>
may compell them to vertuous exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to put their confidence in God only, hauing no other refuge, ſince their eſtate and welth is once forſaken, to which they cannot returne.</p>

                     <p>20. Our Holy Mother S.

conceiued, of great perfection, by reaſon he was a ſingle man neuer marryed, then aged, kept priuat in his owne houſe, was affable of condition, not ſeene angry, endured many troubles, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he did not vſe to ſpeake ill of any, had comforts and conſolations; ſo that many held him for a Saint;</p>

                     <p>22. But why did he behaue himſelfe ſo well, in ſuffering thoſe troubles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout note of impatience? and ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane himſelfe in other occaſions? not out of any true or ſolid vertue; but only

                     <p>9.

                     <p>10. It is alſo certaine, that God the Father, is much more pleaſed with vs, and delighted, when with loue we offer vnto him, his ſweet and deerely beloued ſonne, Chriſt Ieſus and his Holy Merits, and ſufferings, in ſatisfaction of our

                     <p>11.

And though that abſtraction, or alienation of the mynd from all corporeall things, be often with great delight, yet it is not ſo profitable nor ſecure as that contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humanity of Chriſt; neither will they euer come to the true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, pouerty of ſpirit, and perfection, which they may come vnto, by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and withall, theſe ſoules, ſeeme to ſeeke their owne content, and thoſe gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, rather then true abnegation, and conformity to the will of God, and the life of Chriſt, who is the treaſure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and fountaine of all grace, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe;

who had his wounds printed in her flesh, as S.

                     <p>14. Moreouer you may conſider, that in that eleuation of ſpirit from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Sauiour, there is ſome want of humility, by reaſon they doe eleuat their Spirit, before God doth ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat it and would faine be partakers with Chriſt in his conſolations, but not in his tribulations, and become Mary, before they learne, or knowe to doe, the office of Martha; Mary ſate with ſweet content at our Sauiours feete, in deepe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his humanity, and Martha did labour to ſerue him, by her holy action; and both did pleaſe our Sauiour; the actiue life, is the way to the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and he that would faine enioy the comfort of the one, without enduring the labour and trouble of the other is not ſo humble as he ought, and certainly will neuer come to the height of mottifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor perfection. for the leaſt defect of humility in this way of prayer, is of very great importance, and hindereth all
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34971:242"/>
progreſſe in vertue.</p>
                     <p>15. Therefore, in all prayers, whether it be naturall or ſupernaturall, she adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">In her life chap. 21.</note> that we begin with the ſacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and she doth intreat her Ghoſtly Father in his prayer not to doe otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; for it is the true and ſecure way to all perfection; but if it shall pleaſe his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Maieſty, to eleuat your ſpirit, and bring you from the humanity, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ioyfull contemplation of his diuinity, goe freely with him, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes placing humility before you, as a lantarne; for we muſt not be too forward, nor too deſirous of ſpirituall guſts; but modeſt and ciuill, remaining willingly with his ſacred humanity, and think it a great fauour; and that we are wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any of thoſe high fauours, great comforts, and guſtes.</p>
                     <p>16. But for vs to eleuat our ſpirit of our ſelues, from all corporeall things, and the ſacred humanity of Chriſt<hi>!</hi> is to flye before our wings are growen, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to penetrat high miſteryes, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, (which farre exceede our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) before we vnderſtand the miſtery, and great good we haue, by Chriſts holy humanity, which is the ladder to aſcend by, to the diuinity; for as he ſaith, none <note place="margin">

can come to his Father, but by him, who is the way where in none can erre, and without which, they muſt goe aſtray: O who would willingly depriue himſelfe, of ſo great a certainty, and ſecurity to come to our heauenly Father? O who would be ſo vngratefull, as of purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue himſelfe of the memory of thoſe moſt bleſſed tokens of the loue, of the ſon of God, our deere Sauiour to vs wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinners, expreſſed with ſo great pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and the effuſion of his moſt Pretious Blood, by which the ſinns of the world are washed, and taken away? ſurely I think none, but ſuch as came not to the true knowledg, and feeling of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the true loue of God; what, for Gods ſake, doe they ayme at? I should think; at true perfection; and not at guſts, and knowledg of high things; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of true and ſolid vertue, doth conſiſt in the perfect imitation, of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and vertues of Chriſt our Sauiour, as is often ſaid, and the conformity of our will, to the will of God; how then can they imitat whom they will not call to mynd, but of ſet purpoſe forget? how will they come to perfection, who willingly doe leaue, and forſake the rrue way to it?</p>

                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:34971:243"/>
17. Likewiſe it is to be noted, that euen for the bodily health, it is good, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to fall from that high contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuinity, to that of the ſacred humanity, for the bowe which is allwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes bent, is in danger to burſt, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke; and the ſoul which is kept in that height continually, not hauing all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thoſe comforts, nor wherewith to ſettle and employ her ſelfe; which often doth happen; is ſorely tyred, the head hurt, the braine weakned, and the body perhaps brought to ſickneſſe, which I haue ſeene, and knowen, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; but then falling to the ſacred huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, she hath where with to reſt, with eaſe, and employ her ſelfe profitably, conſidering with what loue, our Sauiour ſuffered, thoſe torments, for vs; which is more ſutable, and agreable to our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition?</p>
                     <p>18. And belieue it, that if we humble our ſelues, our Sauiour will exalt vs, and giue vs a more perfect contemplation, and thoſe comforts, and guſtes, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re plentifull manner; for when he doth eleuat our ſpirit, to that contemplation, he preſenteth inſtantly ſufficient matter, to keepe the ſoul ſweetly employed, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any great labour, yea with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34971:244"/>
and delight; but when we doe it of our ſelues, though he doth concurre, yet not neere ſo much, as in the other. by reaſon it is his owne worke, and I may ſay, a reward of that humility, which is not giuen to the other, in which there is a defect of humility, which putteth an obſtacle to the effects, which in prayer are giuen to the truly humble; and our Holy Mother at length doth conclude thus, that if any booke, or Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall direct you otherwiſe, then by the ſacred humanity of our Sauiour, doe it not, for their perſuaſion; but with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, alleage the former reaſons; for this doctrine, she receiued from the mouth of our Sauiour, and by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; she had the triall of both, and found this to be true; and confidently she doth affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his bringing of the Bleſſed ſoules from Lymbus, and his aſcention with them, into heauen, where he is ſitting Gloriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly at the right hand of his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar; all which and many other conſiderations are not painfull, and heauy, but rather comfortable and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</p>
                     <p>20. Alſo, ſome doe alleage, that ſuch as are ariued to ſupernaturall prayer, cannot meditat vppon the paſſion, nor the life of Chriſt, or his ſaints; by reaſon they cannot diſcourſe; and ſo they should labour in vaine; to which our Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth make anſwere ſaijng; that true it is, that in ſupernaturall prayer they cannot meditat or diſcourſe, yet not withſtanding, the memory may preſent ſome one point of his life, or paſſion, to the vnderſtanding, which with one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple looke, may behold, and ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat it; for example, our Sauiour ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with great paine, and loue. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be crowned ſo cruelly with thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or nayled faſt, to the croſſe, for vs; in which view, the vnderſtanding, may reſt ſweetly, with great content; and ſeing how ill, his loue and grieuous paines, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re required by vs; the will, inſtantly,

                     <p>21.
